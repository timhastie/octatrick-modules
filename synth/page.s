| SYNTH MACHINE -- ColdFire code cave, phase 3: the page (22 Sep 2026). GNU as,
| -mcpu=5475. PINNED at 0x400d24d0 (the second zero run): the override list
| below (pg_over) carries absolute pointers to the formatters and widgets, so
| the bytes depend on the address.
|
| WHAT: when the current track's FLEX slot holds an FMSYNTH*- (or SYNTH*-) named sample, the
| PLAYBACK page presents the FM voice instead of a sample player -- the slot
| names read PTCH RATO INDX FINE FDBK DEC (four characters: the boxes are 19 px), the values format as the voice
| understands them (RATIO from the ratio table "0.25".."16", INDEX and FDBK
| 0..127, DECAY as the milliseconds alone / "1.1s" / "HOLD" at 127 -- four characters
| at most, the width of the value field), the four synth slots show their
| value all the time (Digitone style) and draw an icon where the sample dial
| was: two operator boxes, the modulator feeding the carrier (RATIO), a
| sideband spectrum whose bars grow with the index (INDEX), the modulator's
| box with its feedback loop, drawn when FDBK > 0 (FDBK), and the index
| envelope, a falling curve whose length follows the value (DECAY). Every
| icon keeps two pixels clear of the box's dividers (23 Sep 2026: the first
| icons carried M and C letters, ran to the edges and crowded the boxes). The
| footer reads FM SYNTH>FLEX. THE TUNING SYSTEM (27 Sep 2026): PTCH is
| semitones on a synth track -- range 0..127 = -64..+63, one raw unit a
| semitone (the engine, poly.s sy_word, reads it so), printed as a signed
| whole number ("-12", "0", "+7"; the stock formatter's "+7.0" and its
| 5-units-a-semitone stay on sample tracks) in place of the stock
| semitone-snapping accumulator; RATE is FINE, -64..+63 cents (raw 64 = 0,
| "+12c"), default 64. THE KNOBS (30 Sep 2026): all six slots' handlers are
| poly.s's po_knob, planted by po_pgdesc when it finishes the clone -- one unit
| a detent, seven with the knob pressed, and with FUNC held PTCH 12 semitones,
| FINE 10 cents, INDX/FDBK/DEC 16, RATO the next whole-number ratio (the
| stock caller clamps). Non-synth tracks and every other page draw exactly
| as stock.
|
| HOW: the page descriptor resolver 0x40031da4(track, page kind) returns
| tbl[machine] for the PLAYBACK page at 0x40031ece (`movel %a0@(0,%d0:l:4),%d0;
| bras 0x40031ed6`, 6 bytes -> `jmp pg_resolve`). Everything that draws or edits
| the page -- the generic parameter-page renderer 0x4004e0xx, the footer
| 0x4003d5xx, the knob handler 0x40055008 -- reaches the descriptor through it
| (0x40031ee0 / 0x40031f28 tail-call it). The stub replays the lookup and, for
| the FLEX descriptor of a track whose assigned FLEX slot (Part + 0x8f04a +
| track*5 + 1) has a settings record (0x100b14f0 + 0x448*slot) whose path's
| basename starts with "SYNTH" -- loaded into flex RAM or not -- returns the
| synth's descriptor: a RUNTIME CLONE of the stock FLEX record (P..P+0x192),
| built on first use by poly.s's po_pgdesc (the DRAM unit: the copy of the
| stock record from the image and the 402 B of RAM it needs live there; this
| cave has no room for them and, pinned at a fixed address, no way to name the
| unit -- so it takes the builder's address from the long before sy_render,
| whose own address the kind table's FLEX entry 0x400d6438 holds) with only
| the fields pg_over lists changed: the names, the title, the six A
| formatters (P+0xca), the four B widgets (P+0xfa), the enable nibbles
| (P+0x18e: 5/7 = bit 2 "always show the value") and, since the tuning
| system, PTCH's minimum and count (P+0x6a, P+0x9a: 0 and 128), FINE's
| default (P+0x5e+3: 64) and the two knob handlers (P+0x12a, +12: 0) --
| storage, locks, scenes, LFOs and MIDI reach the bytes exactly as before. The stock record itself is never written, and this file
| carries none of its bytes (26 Sep 2026: until then pg_desc was a copy of the
| 402-byte stock record with the fields patched, 347 of them Elektron's).
|
| The renderer draws each box at (x = 60/80/100, y = 36 top row / 8 bottom
| row; y grows UPWARD, screen row = 63 - y): the name centred on x+9 at y+20,
| then widget(x, y, slot, value, flags, fmt, window). With flags bit 3 (the
| nibble's bit 2) the stock dial 0x400479b4 clears the box, draws its circle
| bitmap at (x+4, y+7), the pointer at (x+6, y+9) and the value text centred
| at y+1. Each widget here calls the stock dial first (so the value text, the
| box clear and the lock highlight stay stock's) and then blits a 17 x 13
| column bitmap over the dial at (x+1, y+7) with 0x400128a8(bitmap, window,
| x, y): {width, height, longs per column, columns, mask}, one long per
| column, bit 31 = the bottom row, bit 31-k = row k above it; the blit does
| dst = (dst & ~mask) | (data & mask), so a full mask replaces the area. The
| icon is composed in a RAM scratch (pg_data; the main OS runs from DRAM)
| from static column images (pg_img_*) and a few procedural strokes.
| Formatters have the stock signature fmt(buf, value) -> sprintf.
