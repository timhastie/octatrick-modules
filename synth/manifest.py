"""SYNTH MACHINE -- phases 2+3: a FLEX track whose sample is named SYNTH* plays a
two-operator FM voice instead of the sample. The ColdFire generates the
track's SOURCE sample data every frame, at the track's final pitch, and the
DSP does the rest exactly as for a sample -- RATE, the AMP envelope, filter,
FX1/FX2, level, pan, mute, cue -- while PTCH (with locks, LFOs, scenes,
chromatic keys, the quantizer) is folded into the voice's own phase
increments with the stock renderer's rate arithmetic. Nothing changes for a
track whose sample is not named SYNTH*.

THE VOICE: carrier = sin(phi_c + INDEX * sin(phi_m + FEEDBACK * m_prev)),
phi_m at RATIO times the pitch. The FLEX PLAYBACK page's other slots are its
parameters, read per frame from the DSP parameter record (halfwords, raw <<
8): STRT = RATIO (32-step table 0.25..16), LEN = INDEX (0..8 rad), RTRG =
FEEDBACK (0..0.25 cycle), RTIM = DECAY of the index toward 1/16 (time
constant 2 s * (raw/127)^2; 0 = hold). Phase 3 relabels the slots.

WHERE IT HOOKS. The per-frame record packer (0x4000d3fc) renders each track's
audio through a per-track renderer pointer copied from the kind table
0x400d6434 (kind = machine type; 0 STATIC, 1 FLEX, 2 THRU, 3 NEIGHBOR,
4 PICKUP, 5-7 silent). The FLEX entry 0x400d6438 (stock: the sample renderer
0x40004008) -- and since OCTATRICK2.8 the STATIC entry 0x400d6434 (the same
stock renderer) -- is repointed to sy_render, which, on a sample track with
LEG MONO and GLIDE, slides the record's PTCH word toward its target before
the stock call (poly.s sy_sample; a sample START snaps), and, for a synth track,
writes PTCH := 0 semitones and RATE := 1.0 into the record around the stock
call (so the voice lifecycle, streaming, positions and the record's headers
stay stock's, at 16 source samples a frame), restores them, clears the retrig
count the packer latched at a voice start (RTRG is FEEDBACK, not a retrig),
and overwrites the source pairs the stock renderer shipped. One 4-byte poke,
no displaced instructions.

THE MARKER. The voice struct (0x800049d8 + 0xa8 * track) holds the slot's
settings record at +8 (0x100b14f0 + 0x448 * slot, its path string at +0);
on the frame a voice starts (bit 4 of 0x46104d0c + track, the packer's
event byte) the file name after the last '/' is compared with "SYNTH" and
the result cached per track. Any WAV named SYNTH*.wav in any FLEX slot is
the machine; sample locks choose it per step. A stock unit plays the file
itself (the shipped SYNTH.wav is silence).

THE PAGE (phase 3). The page-descriptor resolver 0x40031da4 is detoured at
its PLAYBACK-page table load (0x40031ece): for a track whose assigned FLEX
slot's sample is named SYNTH* -- by the settings record's path, loaded into
flex RAM or not -- it returns a clone of the FLEX descriptor whose slots read
PTCH RATO INDX FINE FDBK DEC, whose title makes the footer read FM SYNTH>FLEX,
whose formatters print the ratio table's value, 0..127 and HOLD/ms/s, and
whose widgets draw the M->C operator diagram, a sideband spectrum, the
modulator with its feedback loop and the index envelope over the stock dial.
THE TUNING SYSTEM (27 Sep 2026): on a synth track PTCH is semitones, raw 64
= 0, one unit a semitone, -64..+63 (the clone's range 0..127, a signed whole
number on the page, the plain one-a-detent knob handler), and RATE is FINE,
-64..+63 cents (raw 64 = 0, printed "+12c", default 64); the engine (poly.s
sy_word) reads both so and folds any pitch into the stock curve by octaves.
The quantizer module follows the same units on synth tracks (its PTCH knob,
p-lock and CHROMATIC key hooks; the CHROMATIC octave runs -4..+4 there).
Sample tracks are untouched.
The clone is built AT RUNTIME, on first use, by the DRAM unit (poly.s
po_pgdesc: the stock record copied out of the image into the unit's RAM,
then the fields page.s lists -- title, the four names, four formatter and
four widget pointers, the enable nibbles -- written over the copy; the stock
record is never touched, a non-synth track gets it as before, and the flag
and buffer are zero after every boot). The pinned page cave (page.s,
0x400d24d0) holds the resolver stub, the override list, the formatters, the
widgets and the icon data, and reaches the builder through the long
published before sy_render (whose address the kind table's FLEX entry
holds) -- so no stock bytes are in the repository (26 Sep 2026; until then
page.s carried a patched copy of the 402-byte stock record). Ranges,
defaults and knob handlers are the stock record's; every other page and
every non-synth track draws as stock.

THE ENGINE IN DRAM, AND PARAPHONIC CHORDS (phase 5, 24 Sep 2026). The
voice engine is a DRAM unit now, modules/synth/poly.s (`Linked(dram=True)`:
linked into the platform runtime at the arena reserve's base, appended
behind the loader, depacked at boot; the unit gives up 10 MB of sample
memory); the kind table's FLEX entry is pointed at its sy_render by a
SymbolRef (octabam's 4-byte stock pointer rewritten to a symbol; the fork
had added a Detour of kind "ptr" for the same job). On a synth track the LFO page is always a clone
(built from the stock record on first use, a detour at the page resolver's
LFO-descriptor load) whose slot 2 is VOIC (1..4, default 1; SPD3's byte, a
stock or out-of-range byte reads 1) and slot 5 CHRD (the chord shape, "----"
while VOIC is 1); LFO 3 is muted on a synth track (two detours at the LFO
engine's depth read -- the routine and its copy inlined in the frame
builder; its default PMTR is PTCH). VOIC is the switch: 1 = the mono synth
of phase 4, bit for bit (GLIDE legato, the stock lifecycle); 2..4 = that
many voices playing the chord shape at every trig or live key, per-voice
release from the AMP REL byte, per-voice glide, live keys held together
(the quantizer's key hooks feed the engine through a pinned mailbox), every
chord note snapped onto the quantizer's SCALE (its mask through the pinned
trampoline SCALE_AT).

CLICKS AND CRACKLE (28 Sep 2026, poly.s po_fill / po_st_note / po_fade): the
peak limiter's gain and every paraphonic voice's gain ramp linearly across
the 16-sample frame from last frame's value to this frame's (the per-frame
steps were a click at each of the 8 attack frames and a beat-rate crackle
while a chord was held: Tim's MKI, 2.3 .. 2.9); a silent voice starts both
operators at phase 0 with a 16-frame (5.8 ms) attack ramp; a retriggered,
stolen or chord-memory-cut voice is phase-continuous and fades over one
frame instead of being cut. The level law is unchanged (T_GMAX = 32768 /
sqrt(VOIC), chords held at the mono voice's peak). README "Clicks and crackle".
The mono voice (VOIC 1; poly.s sy_render's marker block, sy_mono / sy_loop)
got the same treatment in the next commit: its gain ramps linearly per sample
across each render call (S_GPREV -> S_GAIN, one divs.l a call, a 16 x 16
multiply on gain / 2 -- bit for bit the old output at full gain), a 16-frame
attack (RAMP_STEP 2048), both operators at phase 0 from silence, phase-
the safety-net cut a one-frame fade. OCTATRIK11's pop on every note.
BUILD 25: T_MLEG (MIDI IN's legato flag, po_mon / po_mrec) moved +126 -> +37 --
it aliased S_LASTF's word (the warm rule's frame stamp).
BUILD 26: EVERY START IS COLD -- the warm rule (S_GPREV != 0 and S_LASTF within a
frame: keep the phases and the gain) and S_LASTF are gone; every START clears
S_PHC / S_PHM / S_LASTM / S_GAIN / S_GPREV, both operators at phase 0 and the
gain ramps from 0 over 16 frames. The DSP's AMP envelope restarts at full on the
start frame's first sample at EVERY start, so a warm start after the envelope had
released the note (a re-press, REL 20) exposed the CF's full continuous gain as a
bare step (x22 .. x25 the steady slope) and the CF cannot see that envelope (no
release event covers every path: a sequencer HOLD ends inside the DSP). A phase
reset at gain 0 is inaudible; a retrigger while sounding gets a short dip (the
normal retrigger character); LEG MONO hand-overs never START. The paraphonic
voices keep their warm rule (phase kept, gain ramped from where it is: clean).
PLAN B (28 Sep 2026, BUILD 31): THE ENGINE OWNS THE AMP ENVELOPE. On a synth
track the DSP is presented with an always-open envelope -- sy_render writes the
DSP voice record's halfwords 0/1/2 (0x80000110 + (ping << 9) + 64 t: ATK / HOLD /
REL) := 0 / 0x7f00 / 0x7f00 every synth call, after the copier, the scene morph
and the LFO stage and before the DMA, the live lane the UI shows untouched (the
shape of the PTCH / RATE override) -- and applies ATK / HOLD / REL from the live
lane itself (locks, scenes, LFOs included) with the DSP's laws as measured in
stage 1: ATK a linear ramp to full in 3.85 ms x 2^(v/8.53) (the 16-frame ramp
the floor), HOLD the DSP's timer from the START (po_hold128 steps x frames a
step; 127 = INF) for live keys and trigs alike, ending the note by itself, REL
exponential with tau = 0.295 ms x 2^(v/8.53) floored at 1 ms (a ~2 ms minimum
fade even at REL 0; 127 = INF). THE START RULE replaces BUILD 27/28's four
conditions: a voice that still sounds (S_GPREV / V_GPREV != 0) continues the
SAME oscillator phase-continuously from its current level (the attack re-runs
from there); a silent one starts at phase 0 from 0. Note ends: every note-off
path (po_rel), the HOLD timer, MIDI note-off, the key mask, the sequencer trig,
and STOP (po_stop, a new detour at the frame builder's consumption of the
sequencer's STOP word 0x46c80350, after it posts the DSP all-off). Voice
stealing and chord-memory cuts fade over 8 frames (2.9 ms, state 3). The
per-frame peak limiter is REMOVED: the sum is clamped (saturated) only; the
level law 1/sqrt(VOIC) is unchanged. README "The engine owns the envelope".
BUILD 32 (round 2): a START across a VOIC change never cuts the sounding tone
(VOIC 1 -> 2..4: po_carry moves the mono voice into a fading paraphonic voice;
2..4 -> 1: the voices fade over 8 frames under the mono voice, po_fade_frame /
po_fill_add); STOP ends every voice (S_ON bit 2: REL INF takes the 1 ms floor,
so the level reaches 0 and the next START is cold); T_AK moved off T_POS.
BUILD 37 (29 Sep 2026): SEQUENCER TRIGS ON A STILL-SOUNDING NOTE NO LONGER BUMP.
The frame builder's sequencer path posts a trig on a sounding track to the DSP as
the command byte 0x10 | n (the CF START bit with the trig's sub-frame position n;
0x46104d15[t], copied into the packer's nibble byte at 0x4000c642); the DSP
crossfades its old voice under the new one for ~26 samples, and since both are
the engine's one continuous stream (the warm START rule) the sum is a +5.6 dB /
1.8 ms bump at every trig (BUILD 33's take a: per-frame amplitude 1.85 1.58 1.32
1.13). The panel key's START reaches the DSP as 0x30 (bits 4 and 5, nibble 0)
and is clean. po_retrig, a detour at the copy (0x4000c634), rewrites every START
byte on a synth track whose engine voice is on (S_ON) to that clean form; the
trig lands a frame boundary early (at most 0.34 ms). Measured (root29w/run_f37a.log,
a trig on every step at 120 BPM, VOIC 1 C4, ATK 0 HOLD INF REL 60 INDX 0): max
|step| / the tone's slope x1.01, max |d2| 9, per-frame amplitude 1.00 on every
frame of every trig, the fix fired on every trig (po_rtlog: 39 rewrites, the
bytes 0x14 0x1c 0x15 0x1d ... -> 0x30). po_rtlog (po_clock + 32) stays: 272 B
of counters and a ring, cheap and peekable.

BUILD 38 (29 Sep 2026): A WARM START RAMPS THE INDEX ENVELOPE. With a non-zero
INDX the START rule's instant restart of the FM index envelope (S_ENV / V_ENV :=
ENV_ONE while the carrier continued) was a hard step at every sequencer trig on a
sounding note (BUILD 37 take b: x7.45 the tone's slope, |d2| 4961, 2008 -> 4786
in one sample, the centroid 322 -> 498 Hz in a frame). Now sy_cold / po_st_note
arm a 16-frame ramp (S_ERAMP +81 / V_ERAMP +62): the envelope climbs linearly
from its current value to ENV_ONE in 5.8 ms (sy_env_ramp / po_fr_envk: the
remaining distance over the remaining frames), then the DEC decay runs from the
peak as before; a cold START (a silent voice) keeps the instant restart. And the
per-sample multiplier I * E is interpolated across every frame: S_IEFF / V_IEFF
are the running value, sy_loop / po_fi_loop step them by S_ISTEP (+126, the
word S_HOLD / S_KEYED held) / V_ISTEP (+38), (target - running) / 16, once a
frame -- no frame-edge step for the ramp, the decay or a knob. V_GPREV is a word
at +60. Measured (root29x/run_v38b.log, take b: HOLD INF REL 60 INDX 40 DEC 40,
a trig every step): max |step| / the tone's slope x1.07, max |d2| 88 against
the take's own 99.9th pct 108, the centroid moving over ~8 ms.

BUILD 33 (round 3): STOP ENDS THE ENGINE'S VOICES AT THE STOCK VOICE KILL. Round 2
measured (root29q-verify/run_stop.log) that po_stop's site 0x4000b2c8 never runs
on the rig for any STOP form -- the global word's writers (0x4009bbb8 / 0x4009c3a0
/ 0x400a4d8c) sit behind [0x80000060] and the pattern-state bytes 0x80006511/12,
and the frame builder's consumer behind two more gates -- so a REL INF tone kept
sounding 1.1 .. 1.6 s past STOP until the stock voice ended, S_GPREV stayed at
full, and the next START after a STOP was warm at full into a re-opened DSP
voice: a click. What every UI path uses to end a stock voice HARD is the VOICE
KILL 0x40006820(t; t >= 8 = all tracks, recursing per track): the sequencer's
STOP / pattern change 0x40043c50, the sample preview stop 0x40093ec0 /
0x40096ad4, the loaders 0x4007eb3e / 0x4008044e / 0x4000f518, the frame
builder's own 0x4000d45a. po_kill is a detour at its CF voice-byte clear
0x4000685c (interrupts masked, d1 = the track): the killed track's engine
record ends at that instant -- S_GAIN / S_GPREV / S_HTIM / S_ON := 0, the four
paraphonic voices freed with V_KEY / V_HOLD 0 -- so nothing of ours sounds
after the kill and the next START is cold. po_stop stays as belt-and-braces (a
killed track has S_ON 0: it does nothing there).
History, BUILD 27: WARM ONLY WHEN THE DSP IS PROVABLY SUSTAINING AT FULL -- BUILD 26's
cold start made a new key while the old note still sounds (LEG OFF, HOLD INF) a
hard cut at the frame edge (a -12 dB 5 ms click). sy_cold keeps the phases and
the gain (the pitch changes, no ramp) only when (a) the HOLD the lane held at the
sounding note's START was INF (S_HOLD, +126, stored at every START, locks
applied), (b) no release reached the frame builder since (S_ON bit 1: po_rel, a
detour at the builder's mailbox-0x40 consumer 0x4000b51a, one site for the panel
release, the MIDI note-off and the sequencer; not set when the same word carries
the START, bit 2 -- the panel's key-while-held), (c) S_GPREV != 0; else cold.
BUILD 28: (d) THE START IS A LIVE KEY'S OR A MIDI NOTE'S -- a sequencer trig
STARTs the mono voice with no note-off anywhere (at HOLD INF the flag is never
set), and the DSP restarts something at each trig the CF cannot see: warm there
layered (+5.75 dB over the mono voice, a bare step a trig, BUILD 27 measured).
sy_cold reads qz_pkey[t] (KEYS_AT, the identity the quantizer posts for a
CHROMATIC key, index + 1, and po_mon for a MIDI note, 0x80 | note; 0 for a
sequencer trig -- what po_start takes as d7) before the mono path clears it,
stores it at S_KEYED (+127, the record's last byte, peekable) and the START is
warm only when it is nonzero as well; a sequencer START is always cold.
Also BUILD 26: the ramp's step a sample is (target - previous) / 16, the FRAME's
slope, and S_GPREV takes the gain the ramp reached -- a sequencer trig splits
every frame at its sub-frame offset, so dividing by the call's samples put the
frame's whole step into the short second call (a stair on every sequencer note,
103/s; BUILD 25's warm rule made those notes a bare step each, x14 .. x24).
Measured BUILD 26: onset x0.99, re-press 50 / 200 / 600 ms x1.07 / x1.02 / x1.07,
16th trigs HOLD 6 max |d2| 24 (was 4769), the retrigger while sounding a cut to
0 then the 16-frame attack (the cost, -15 dB for 6 ms); README.

MIDI IN (30 Sep 2026, poly.s "MIDI IN"): MIDI notes into a synth track
behave like the panel keys. The STANDARD note map's chromatic block
(0x4000e6e2; AUDIO NOTE IN = STANDARD, or FOLLOW TM in the TRACKS trig
mode) posted a voice command and a PTCH lock byte per listening track with
no identity: the engine took every note as a sequencer trig. Five detours,
synth tracks only, sample tracks byte for byte stock: the voice command
0x4000e746 (po_mon: raw = note - 20, semitones, 84 = 0, 20..127 = -64..+43,
0..19 clamp, stored as the lock byte before the START; the note joins the track's held-note list, its (identity 0x80
| note, raw) is queued for the engine's START, which starts one voice per
queued note-on at its own pitch with the engine's key rules -- "----": one
voice a note, VOIC the polyphony, a repeated note-on absorbed; a shape:
chord memory), the note-off's compare 0x4000dfd4 and its octave switch 0x4000de10 (po_moff, po_mogate: the note leaves
the list; a paraphonic track releases that note's voice alone and only the
last note's release posts the stock AMP release), the octave switch
0x4000e452 (po_mgate: a note outside 72..96 whose channel addresses a
synth track goes to the chromatic block for the channel's synth tracks
alone; the STANDARD functions of 24..71 do not run for such a channel),
the 0x41 event's live recorder 0x400625e0 (po_mrec: the note goes through
po_keyrec as a key of its own -- fingered chords from a MIDI keyboard are
recognised and locked as PTCH / CHRD / VOIC on the first note's step; a
single note records its trig and a PTCH lock in semitones) and its
trig-held branch 0x4006262a (po_mtrig: the held trig's PTCH lock in
semitones). Velocity is ignored (stock keeps none for audio tracks), MIDI
note OUT and the panel keys are untouched; FOLLOW TM with the CHROMATIC
trig mode is the key handler's own path (key = note - 72, 25 keys) and is
unchanged.

TRANSPOSING A HELD STEP (4 Oct 2026). FUNC + UP / DOWN with a [TRIG] key
held for locking on a synth track in GRID RECORDING (any trig mode: the
keys edit steps whatever the mode there) moves every held step's PTCH lock
an octave (12 semitones) up or down, clamped -64..+63, a step without a
lock starting from the Part's PTCH; one detour at the trig-mode selector's
window test 0x40051fce (po_octave), which stores as the lock editor does
and redraws the page. No trig held, a sample track, GRID RECORDING off:
the selector, byte for byte.

FINE DEFAULTS TO 0c (28 Sep 2026, poly.s po_assign / po_machwin /
po_machlist). FINE is the stock RATE byte, whose default is 127 (+63c), so a
fresh synth track read +63c until the user turned it down (Tim's report).
Three 8-byte jmp detours at the stock sites that make a track a FLEX track
of a slot -- the slot assigner's slot-byte write 0x400795ba (both the
machine window and the sample-list window call the assigner 0x40079424
when the slot differs) and the two windows' machine-only writes 0x40079816
/ 0x4005a848 (the slot equal, the machine changed) -- reset RATE := 64 in
the Part's FLEX PLAYBACK bytes, their battery-RAM shadow and the live lane
when the track IS a synth track after the write (FLEX, the FLEX slot's
sample named FMSYNTH* / SYNTH*) and WAS NOT one before it (the machine not
FLEX, or the slot not a marker). A synth track already keeps its FINE
(re-assignments, project load, Part reload, pattern change, warm boot: no
site runs), a sample track is never written, RATE p-locks are untouched.
THE NEW-PROJECT CASE (BUILD 22, poly.s po_loadsel): Tim's MKI still read
+63c on the FIRST FM machine of a project -- in a fresh project every track
already owns its slot in both columns (T1 = slot 1 .. T8 = slot 8, every slot
empty; the port boots them STATIC), the first marker is loaded INTO the
track's own slot, and neither the machine nor the
slot byte changes (the assigner takes its same-slot exit; the sample-list
window's LOAD FILE never touches the Part): none of the three sites runs.
The fourth site is the file browser's select 0x40022610, whose `jsr
0x40013a08` (sprintf) writes the chosen path into the slot's settings record
-- `jsr po_loadsel` reads the slot's marker state before and after the
write and, when it went non-marker -> marker, resets FINE on every FLEX
track whose FLEX slot is that slot. A marker over a marker, a sample over a
marker, a STATIC slot, a recorder buffer: untouched.
