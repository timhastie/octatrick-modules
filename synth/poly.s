| SYNTH MACHINE -- the FM voice engine as a DRAM unit, phase 5: paraphonic
| chords (24 Sep 2026). GNU as, -mcpu=5475. Linked by the build into the
| platform runtime at the base of the arena reserve (docs/remixer/
| PLACEMENT.md); the kind table's FLEX entry 0x400d6438 is pointed at
| sy_render by a "ptr" detour (modules/synth/manifest.py). synth.s, the ROM
| cave this grew out of, is kept beside it for the record: everything under
| "the mono voice" below is that cave's code; at VOIC 1 the steady samples
| are the same, bit for bit, the note's start is not (clicks, see below).
|
| WHAT (phases 1-4, unchanged): a FLEX track whose sample is named SYNTH* has
| its sample data GENERATED here every frame instead of taken from the flex
| pool -- a two-operator FM voice at the final pitch, 16 samples a frame at
| rate 1.0 (the DSP's resampler is an identity), carrier = sin(phi_c + I *
| sin(phi_m + fb * m_prev)); the PLAYBACK page's other slots are RATIO
| (STRT), INDEX (LEN), FEEDBACK (RTRG), DECAY (RTIM); PTCH and RATE go
| through the stock renderer's own rate arithmetic; GLIDE (the project
| setting at GLIDE_AT) slews the pitch. The stock renderer is still called
| around every frame (the voice lifecycle, streaming and the record's
| headers are its), with PTCH := 0 and RATE := 1.0 for the call.
|
| PARAPHONIC (phase 5). VOIC, the LFO page's slot 2 on a synth track (SPD3's
| byte, the page names it VOIC: 1..4, a stock or out-of-range byte reads 1),
| is the switch: at 1 the track is the mono synth of phase 4 (this file's
| mono path, GLIDE legato, the stock voice lifecycle, bit for bit); at 2..4
| a voice START makes the track paraphonic (T_POLY, latched per note): that
| many voices, each with its own phases, index envelope, slewed pitch and
| amplitude envelope, summed into the track's one source stream, each at
| 1/VOIC of the mono voice's level (28 Sep 2026; half level before):
|   * a voice START (the packer's event bit 4: a sequencer trig or a live
|     CHROMATIC key) allocates one voice per note of the CHORD SHAPE --
|     the track's LFO page slot 5 byte (DEP3's storage, the "current value"
|     byte 0x80000810 + t*72 + 11, so a step lock on that slot picks the
|     shape per step), raw = shape << 2 | inversion (26 Sep 2026): 32 shapes
|     of four semitone offsets each (a VOICING in priority order, 29 Sep
|     2026; "----" is the one note), rotated into the inversion by
|     po_voicing (the bass = PTCH) -- at the record's PTCH word plus the offset,
|     each note snapped onto the quantizer's SCALE when one is set (po_snap:
|     the mask through the pinned accessor SCALE_AT, nearest degree, ties
|     down -- a MAJ shape in a minor scale comes out MIN). VOIC (current
|     value 0x80000810 + t*72 + 8, locks honoured) is the track's VOICE
|     CAP (27 Sep 2026): at most VOIC voices sound on the track, keys and
|     chords alike. With a shape a start plays the shape's first VOIC notes
|     (2, 3 or 4 of every shape) and is CHORD MEMORY (29 Sep 2026): every
|     voice of the track's previous chord is cut first, so exactly VOIC
|     voices sound and two keys never mix chords. With "----" a key is one
|     voice and VOIC is the polyphony: when the active voices (sounding or
|     releasing) plus 1 would exceed VOIC, the oldest of them is cut first
|     (releasing before sounding, po_steal), so VOIC 2 is a duophonic
|     keyboard (a third key takes the oldest). Each note then takes a free
|     voice, else the oldest releasing one, else the oldest sounding one (a
|     global allocation stamp, V_AGE);
|   * a live key (the quantizer's key hooks leave the key's index+1 in
|     qz_pkey[t] at KEYS_AT and keep the mask of held keys in qz_pmask[t])
|     tags its voices with the key; releasing the key (its bit leaves the
|     mask) puts them into RELEASE. A sequencer trig (qz_pkey[t] == 0)
|     first releases every sounding voice of the track: notes sustain
|     until the next trig;
|   * THE AMP ENVELOPE IS THE ENGINE'S (plan B, BUILD 31/32): the DSP sees ATK 0
|     / HOLD INF / REL INF on a synth track (sy_ison) and each voice, mono or
|     paraphonic, runs the live lane's ATK / HOLD / REL with the DSP's measured
|     laws (po_mono_env, po_frame): ATK a linear ramp to full in 3.85 ms x
|     2^(v/8.53) (16 frames the floor, po_atk; 2.10: at least one carrier
|     period, S-shaped, po_alaw); HOLD a timer from the START,
|     po_hold128 x frames a step (127 = INF), the note ends by itself; REL
|     exponential, tau = 0.295 ms x 2^(v/8.53) floored at 1 ms (po_relk), 127
|     = INF: the voice sustains until stolen -- except after STOP (po_stop:
|     S_ON bit 2), when INF takes the 1 ms floor so every voice reaches
|     silence and the next START is cold. A start while the voice still
|     sounds continues it phase-continuously from its level (the START rule);
|   * PITCH per voice: target = V_ROOT + (PTCH word - the word at the last
|     start), so a lock or slide or LFO on PTCH moves every voice by the
|     same interval (and each voice slews it with GLIDE, sy_slew on its own
|     V_CUR) while a new key's word does not move the voices already
|     sounding (V_ROOT absorbs the delta at each start). The word is folded
|     into the stock curve's 24-semitone range by octaves before the rate
|     arithmetic and the increment shifted back, so a chord note up to three
|     octaves above PTCH +12 keeps the stock's tuning;
|   * LEVEL (29 Sep 2026, equal power): each voice is c * gain with gain
|     Q15 as the mono voice's, its full value T_GMAX = 32768 / sqrt(VOIC)
|     latched at the start (po_gmax: 23170, 18919, 16384 at VOIC 2, 3, 4),
|     the sum doubled into the mono format exactly as the mono path does
|     (c * g << 1: the high word is the sample) with a saturating clamp only
|     (plan B: the peak limiter is gone). A single note is 3.0 / 4.8 / 6.0 dB
|     below the mono voice at VOIC 2 / 3 / 4; a VOIC 4 chord's coincident
|     peaks reach 2.0 FS and clamp. A stolen or chord-memory voice fades over
|     8 frames (state 3, T_GMAX / 8 a frame; 2.10: at least one period of the
|     voice, S-shaped); a voice above the cap (a tail
|     from a lower VOIC, the mono voice carried in) converges on it at that
|     rate; a voice is freed below gain 64 (-54 dB re the mono voice's full
|     scale) once po_fill has ramped it there;
|   * VOIC ACROSS A NOTE (BUILD 32): a START never cuts what sounds. VOIC 1 ->
|     2..4 while the mono voice sounds: po_carry moves it into a voice record
|     (state 3, phase-continuous, its own pitch) and the chord's voices join
|     it; VOIC 2..4 -> 1: sy_warm's po_fade fades the voices over 8 frames
|     under the mono voice (po_fade_frame steps them, po_fill_add sums them
|     onto its samples) and the mono voice starts cold;
|   * A PITCH CHANGE ON A SOUNDING MONO NOTE (2.10): a START at another pitch
|     (half a semitone or more from the sounding word) crossfades -- the old
|     tone becomes a fading voice (po_carry; one period of the lower note,
|     S-shaped) and the new note starts cold from phase 0 with its attack; the
|     same pitch stays phase-continuous (the index ramp, po_erlen);
| The stock voice lifecycle is untouched: a new key restarts the DSP voice
| (the AMP and filter envelopes run over the whole mix as for a sample), a
| released last key posts the AMP release as stock. Musically: AMP ATK 0,
| HOLD INF, REL to taste -- the per-voice envelopes shape the notes.
|
| THE TUNING SYSTEM (27 Sep 2026): on a synth track PTCH is SEMITONES -- raw
| 64 = 0, one unit a semitone, -64..+63 (the page clone gives the slot that
| range and prints a signed whole number) -- and RATE is FINE, -64..+63
| cents (raw 64 = 0; the page names it FINE). sy_word turns the record's two
| halfwords into the engine's pitch word on the stock curve's scale (SEMI =
| 5 << 8 a semitone; w = 0x4000 + (ptch - 0x4000) * 5 + (fine - 0x4000) *
| 12.8), where everything below -- the mono voice, GLIDE's slew, the chords'
| intervals, po_snap -- works as before; po_rate_fold folds any word into the
| curve's +-12 semitones by octaves (the mono path shares the paraphonic
| path's folding now) and RATE never scales a synth voice (po_rate sees
| 1.0). An LFO on PTCH sweeps ONE SEMITONE per unit of depth on a synth
| track, five times the sample tracks' 0.2. Sample tracks: untouched.
|
| ALSO HERE: po_lfo3 / po_lfo3b (detours at the depth read of the LFO engine's
| two copies, 0x40003ca4 and 0x4000d03e: LFO 3's depth is read as 0 on a track
| whose playing voice is a synth, whatever VOIC -- its slots are VOIC and CHRD
| there, and LFO 3's default PMTR is PTCH, so a chord byte read as its depth
| was a pitch LFO: the same key gave a different pitch each press) and
| po_lfopage (a detour at the page resolver's LFO-descriptor load 0x40031e62:
| every synth track gets a clone of the LFO descriptor built here on first
| use, slot 2 named VOIC printing 1..4 with that range and default 1, slot 5
| named CHRD printing the shape's name, or "----" while VOIC is 1), and
| po_pgdesc (26 Sep 2026: the FM SYNTH PLAYBACK descriptor page.s returns is
| built here too, on first use, from the stock FLEX record in the image plus
| page.s's overrides -- the pinned page cave carries no stock bytes; page.s
| reaches the builder through the pointer word published before sy_render).
|
| Layout: the page clone's accessor word, code, then the tables (ratio,
| shapes, names, po_relk, the sine table) and the RAM state (per-track
| records, 32 voice records, the LFO and PLAYBACK descriptor clones). The
| main OS runs from DRAM and so does this.

| curve's scale, 5 raw units a semitone) is the TARGET: sy_slew moves S_CUR
| toward it over GLIDE -- snapped at a sample start (sy_no) and whenever GLIDE
| is 0 or the track's LEG is OFF (stock's instant pitch) -- and the slewed
| word replaces the record's for the stock call. The stock rate arithmetic
| (0x40004008; docs/firmware/REPITCH.md) reads the word from the record on
| this call, so the increment it builds -- shared by the source supplier and
| the DSP voice command -- follows the slide. Nothing is restored after the
| call: the record holds what stock leaves there, as on a stock unit. A live
| legato key (LEG MONO: the trigless path), a sequenced trigless trig's PTCH
| lock, a knob turn or an LFO all arrive as the record's word changing
| between starts, so they all slide; a sample trig's lock lands at a start

|   SOUNDING with a finite HOLD (S_HTIM, armed by sy_cold from the lane's HOLD
|     at the START): the timer runs out -> the release starts by itself (the

|     2^(ATK / 8.53), the 16-frame ramp its floor, the step at least 1), capped
|     at full -- from wherever the level is (a warm START re-attacks from its
|     current level; a cold one from 0). 2.10: the step goes through po_alaw --
|     no faster than one carrier period, S-shaped at the same total time (linear

| halfword difference / 20 (3277 / 65536; 0.006 % off: 0.004 cent at +-64). The word runs from 0x4000 - 64 * SEMI to 0x4000
| + 63.6 * SEMI, far outside the curve's +-12; the callers fold it by octaves
| (po_rate_fold), and the slew (sy_slew) and the chord arithmetic take it as

| went 1 -> 2..4 across a note, live or by a lock). The mono voice's fields +0..+35
| (phases, index envelope, increments, I * E, gain, feedback, the modulator's last
| sample -- the voice record's first 36 bytes are the same layout) move into a
| free voice (else the quietest active one), state 3: it FADES over 8 frames
| (po_fr_cut, T_GMAX / 8 a frame -- from 32767 at VOIC 4 that is 16 frames, 5.8
| ms) at its own pitch (V_ROOT such that po_start's fold of T_LAST - T_REF and the
| new T_REF leave its target word at S_CUR's), phase-continuous from S_GPREV --
| unless the chord's allocation takes it warm first (po_alloc: rank 0 like a free
| voice, but stamped newest, so free voices go first). The gains are capped at
| 32767 (po_fill's 16 x 16 multiply; the mono voice's 32768 would read as -1).
| The mono record is silent after it (S_GAIN / S_GPREV 0). a3 = the track record,

| ==== LEG POLY: the legato hand-over on a paraphonic track (2 Oct 2026) ===========
| po_legkey (UI task, through the pointer block's -28: the quantizer's qz_leg2 for
| a CHROMATIC key, po_mon for a MIDI note): d2 = track, d0 = the identity of the
| key pressed while others are held, with LEG = POLY and VOIC 2..4. The press
| takes the stock TRIGLESS path (no START: the AMP envelope is not retriggered,
| the staged PTCH lock lands at the next frame); this only notes the key in the
| track record, and the frame (po_frame) does the rest once the lock has
| landed, po_handover:
|   * the PTCH delta since the last start is folded into every voice's root
|     and T_REF := T_W, so the targets below are absolute;
|   * WITH A SHAPE (chord memory): the voicing of (shape, inversion) for VOIC
|     notes at the new root (po_voicing, each note snapped onto the SCALE) is
|     assigned to the sounding voices in pitch order -- voice i slides (sy_slew,
|     from where it is, over GLIDE) to note i and belongs to the new key; with
|     more sounding voices than notes the extra ones release, with fewer the
|     missing notes start fresh voices;
|   * WITH "----": the NEWEST sounding voice (the highest V_AGE) slides to the
|     key's pitch and becomes the key's; the others hold (last-note legato).
|     No sounding voice: a fresh one (po_start1). (A key inside 150 ms of the
|     last key START is a chord press and never comes here: po_legmode.)
|   * a panel key is marked in T_SMASK (the same-scan sweep never starts it).
| Releasing: the old key's bit leaves the mask with nothing tagged to it; the
| voices go with the new key's release (po_frame's scan), and the last key's
| release posts the stock AMP release (the quantizer's qz_leg0, po_moff).
| GLIDE OFF: sy_slew snaps, so the chord changes at once without a retrigger.

| ==== PARAPHONIC: the samples -- every sounding voice summed into the record =====
| From sy_check: a1 = the first L long, d7 = the source count, a3 = the track
| record, 52(sp) = track. Each voice adds c * gain (Q15, at most T_GMAX =
| 32768 / sqrt(VOIC)) into the L long: the sum is Q29 with FS = 0x20000000 =
| 32768 * 0x4000, the mono voice's full scale (c = +-0x4000), the ceiling
| the DSP chain wants (above it the track clipped, 28 Sep 2026). PLAN B (28 Sep
| 2026): the final pass is the doubling into the mono format with a SATURATING
| CLAMP on the sum only -- the peak limiter that follows in this note is HISTORY
| (removed: its gain movement was itself a level modulation under chords; the
| level law 1/sqrt(VOIC) alone bounds a single note at 0.5 FS and a VOIC 4 chord's
| coincident peaks at 2.0 FS, clamped). History (29 Sep 2026): a PEAK LIMITER, a gain and not a curve: the frame's
| peak |x| is scanned; the track's gain g (T_LIM, Q16) releases toward 1.0
| by 1/2048 of the deficit a frame (tau = 0.74 s) and is pulled down to FS /
| peak at once when this frame's peak would pass FS, so no sample ever
| exceeds FS (the attack is the frame, 0.36 ms, and the sum only grows over
| the 8-frame ramp or a beat, so the steps are small); at g = 1.0 (a single
| note at any VOIC peaks at 0.71 FS at most; chords until their peaks
| coincide) the samples pass untouched; else each is x * g (mac.l, the
| fractional EMAC as po_rate uses it). A silent frame (peak 0: every voice
| freed) and po_free (a chord-memory start) reset g to 1.0. Then the doubling
| as the mono path does (c * g << 1, the high word is the sample) and R := L.
| A soft-clip curve was simulated first and rejected: with equal-power gains
| two notes at VOIC 2 sum to 1.41 FS at every coincidence, and any waveshaper
| under 1.0 FS puts intermodulation at -17..-19 dB on ordinary chords -- the
| clipping of OCTATRIK11 again, only rounder. The gain costs 6 instructions
| a sample for the scan and 4 for the multiply (only while g < 1.0), plus a
| divu.l a frame while limiting. The saturation after the doubling is only a
| guard: |x * g| <= FS always.

| ==== THE LFO DESTINATION LIST (b68, 6 Oct 2026; I2's study, three hooks) ==========

| 4 FX2: the resolver's page kinds) and prints it through the stock formatter 0x4003bf64
| (the LFO descriptor's slot-6 formatter), which takes the PLAYBACK names from the machine
| table 0x400d5f38 itself and the LFO page's from the stock descriptor -- not through the
| page resolver page.s and po_lfopage hook -- so a synth track listed STRT LEN RATE RTRG
| RTIM and SPD3 / DEP3. The list now reads PTCH RATO INDX FINE FDBK DEC | ATK HOLD REL VOL
| BAL | SPD1 SPD2 DEP1 DEP2 | FX1 | FX2 on a synth track: VOIC / CHRD (the bytes of SPD3 /
| DEP3 there: a voice count and a chord shape, no destinations) are stepped over. The stock edit 0x400392cc walks the 30 entries in display
| order (PLAYBACK AMP LFO FX1 FX2: stock's tables 0x400a72a8 value -> position, 0x400a7280

| ==== po_knob(slot, detents, value) -> d0 = the new raw value: the FM SYNTH page's
| knob handler (30 Sep 2026) ==================================================
| The stock knob routine 0x40055008 (PARAM_PAGES.md) reads the Part byte, calls
| the descriptor's per-slot handler (P+0x12a + 4*slot; 0 = its default stepper
| 0x4003240c) with (slot, detents, value) on the C stack, clamps d0 to the
| slot's [min, min+count-1] (P+0x6a, P+0x9a) and stores the byte -- so this
| routine never clamps: PTCH -64..+63 (raw 0..127), FINE the same, INDX FDBK
| DEC 0..127, RATO 0..127 (positions 0..31 of the ratio table, raw >> 2). The
| flags are read the way the stock handlers read them (0x40032d08, the sample
| tracks' PTCH; 0x4003240c): [FUNCTION] is the long 0x46c7dd26 (nonzero while
| held), the encoder's PUSH switch is the key record of code 0x38 + slot
| (PANEL.md: records of 0x18 B at 0x46c7d8de; +0x10 nonzero while the key is
| held), and PERSONALIZE's DISABLE FUNCTION + ENCODER is the long 0x800000a0
| (nonzero = the FUNC layer is off, as in the stock handlers). What a detent
| does (manual 5.2.1 / 5.2.2 on the synth's own units):
|   plain           one unit (a semitone, a cent, one of 128, the next ratio)
|   knob pressed    seven units (QUICK PARAMETER EDITING)
|   FUNC held       PTCH 12 semitones (an octave), FINE 10 cents, INDX FDBK DEC
|                   16 units; RATO the next position whose ratio is a whole
|                   number -- 1 2 3 .. 16 at positions 3 9 12 14 17 19 21 23
|                   24 .. 31 -- and below 1 the three sub-unity entries 0.75
|                   0.5 0.25 (positions 2 1 0); off either end the value stays
|   (FUNC wins over the push; the caller's clamp ends every run)
| A synth track's PTCH with the SCALE on: the quantizer's store hook (qz_knob
| at 0x40055170) recomputes the value from the detent count, by scale degree,
| as it does for the stock handler -- FUNC and the push count as degrees there.
| Sample tracks never reach this routine (their PLAYBACK page is stock).
| Clobbers d0/d1/a0 (C scratch); d2-d4 saved.

| ==== FINGERED CHORDS: po_keyrec / po_keyrel (UI task; 26 Sep 2026, the second pass) ==
| po_keyrec is reached from the quantizer twice per recorded key, through the
| pointer published 12 bytes before sy_render, with d2 = track, d3 = the key's
| IDENTITY (a panel key's index + 1, 1..25; 0x80 | note for a MIDI note, from
| po_mrec), a2 = its raw pitch (64 = 0 semitones, snapped onto the SCALE by
| the quantizer): FIRST from qz_leg3 / po_mrec, at the live recorder's entry,
| with d0 = -1 -- the JOIN query: does this key join the chord being
| recorded? If so the chord's step gets its locks here and d0 := 1, and the
| quantizer skips the stock recorder for the key (no trig of its own); else
| d0 := 0 and the key is recorded as stock. THEN, for a key recorded as
| stock, from qz_leg5 / po_mrec (after the recorder wrote the key's trig and
| PTCH lock) with d0 = the step it was recorded on: a new record starts
| with that key. Runs only while the recorder is on (both detours sit
| inside its block: LIVE RECORDING, or a trig held) and only on a synth
| track whose Part VOIC is 2..4 and CHRD is "----" (the player chose no
| shape). po_keyrel, at every key release (the quantizer's qz_holdrel, a
| MIDI note-off), is the hand-over rule below.
| THE RULES (the second pass, after the 50-take investigation of 2.4):
|   * THE WINDOW: a record (po_chord, 32 B a track) starts at a key press and
|     keeps that key's step; a later press JOINS it while the record is
|     OPEN: less than KR_WIN frames (150 ms, whatever the tempo) since the
|     LAST key that joined -- a roll of five keys 100 ms apart is one chord
|     -- and at least one key of the record still held (a released first key
|     no longer closes it). The record is its keys still held, in order,
|     plus the new one, four at most; the recognition re-runs at every join
|     and the last result stands. A key pressed later starts a new record.
|   * THE HAND-OVER: a join is PROVISIONAL for KR_CONF frames (50 ms). When
|     another key of the record goes up inside that time, the new key was a
|     melody's next note taken with the finger still on the last -- legato,
|     not a chord: po_keyrel undoes the join (the earlier keys' locks again)
|     and gives the key the trig of its own it was denied, at its own time.
|     After KR_CONF frames both keys were held together: the join stands.
|   * THE MATCH (po_match): played intervals = each key's raw minus the
|     lowest, unreduced; for every inversion 0..3 in turn, every shape in
|     table order, the VOICING of (shape, inversion) for n = the keys held
|     (po_voicing: the shape's n highest-priority notes rotated so that the
|     inversion's note is the bass) -- the first whose intervals EQUAL the
|     played ones is the chord: E G B C is MA7 inv 1, E G C5 is MAJ inv 1, C
|     D is SU2, D F A C is MI7 (root positions first, so a root position
|     outranks another shape's inversion). No exact voicing: the second pass
|     takes the (shape, inversion) whose n notes are the played PITCH
|     CLASSES (mod 12) with the voicing span closest to the played span (C3
|     E4 G4 is MAS, the spread). Nothing: the root alone.
|   * THE LOCKS, written on the FIRST key's step with the stock writer
|     (LOCK_WRITE, as the quantizer writes HOLD): PTCH := the lowest key
|     (the played bass: the voicing's bass on playback); with a match CHRD
|     := shape << 2 | inversion and VOIC := min(keys, the Part's VOIC) --
|     the voices that were heard (the engine drops the newest key of a
|     chord press at the cap, po_st_cpress), so playback has the count the
|     take had; without one no CHRD/VOIC lock (a lock this record wrote
|     before is removed, 0xff). A joined key leaves no trig of its own and
|     no HOLD lock: the chord's length is the first key's.
| Live: unchanged (the engine plays the keys you hold); if the live voices
| differ from the shape's chosen notes (VOIC below the keys: the engine kept
| the oldest keys, the shape keeps its priorities) they are left as they
| are. Playback: PTCH + the voicing of (shape, inversion) with VOIC voices.
| po_keyrec clobbers d1, a0, a1 (C scratch); d0 := 1 when the key joined.

| ---- po_voicing: the voicing of (shape d0, inversion d1) for n = d3 voices ----
| The n semitone offsets above the bass, ascending, into (a1); d0 := the
| shape's distinct pitch classes m (1..4). The row's four notes (po_shapes,
| priority order) are sorted by pitch; a note whose pitch class a lower note
| already has is a DOUBLING (the octaves of 4TH, MAJ ..., three of them in
| OCT); the m distinct notes are rotated for the inversion (inv mod m: the
| bass is the inv-th distinct note, the ones below it go up by octaves until
| above it), then each doubling becomes an octave of a rotated note in
| ascending order (the k-th doubling = the (k mod m)-th note + 12 * (k div m
| + 1)), every note is taken relative to the bass, and the n notes of the
| highest PRIORITY (the row order, kept through the sorting) are the
| voicing, ascending. So MAJ (0 4 7 12) inv 1 at n = 3 is 0 3 8 (E G C5 from
| E), at n = 4 0 3 8 12 (E5 doubled); 4TH inv 1 is a 5TH; MA7 inv 2 is 0 4 5
| 9 (G B C E from G). Clobbers d0, d1, a0; everything else preserved.

| ---- po_keyrel: a key released (UI task) -- the hand-over rule ------------------
| Reached through the pointer published 20 bytes before sy_render from the
| quantizer's qz_holdrel (every CHROMATIC key release on a synth track: d2 =
| track, d0 = the key index, a0 = the track's four HOLD slots -- key, step,
| in use, pad, ticks) and from po_moff (a MIDI note-off: d0 = 0x80 | note,
| a0 = 0). Preserves every register. When the record's provisional key is
| younger than KR_CONF frames and ANOTHER key of the record goes up, the
| provisional key was a HAND-OVER: it leaves the record, the record's step
| gets its locks from the keys before it (po_kr_write: PTCH the earlier note
| again, a CHRD/VOIC lock removed or the smaller chord), and the key gets
| the trig of its own it was denied, at its own time (REC_TRIG with the
| recorder's context word saved at its press), its PTCH lock, and -- a panel
| key -- a HOLD slot in the quantizer's table (its press ticks), so its
| release writes its length as for any key; the next record is that key
| alone on that step. The provisional key's own release, or a release after
| KR_CONF: the join stands.

| ==== MIDI IN (30 Sep 2026): MIDI notes into a synth track behave like the panel keys ==
| The STANDARD note map's chromatic block (0x4000e6e2, reached for notes 72..96
| by the octave switch at 0x4000e452 of the audio-track note-on 0x4000e018)
| posts, for every track listening on the message's channel, the voice
| command 0x1d into the mailbox 0x46c80354[t] and the PTCH lock byte the
| frame builder applies at the START -- no identity, one held note a track
| (0x400d64c2[t]), and the note-off 0x4000db98 releases only when that byte
| is the note. Five detours (modules/synth/manifest.py), all landing here:
|   * po_mon at the block's voice command 0x4000e746: a synth track's raw
|     is SEMITONES, raw = note - 20 (84 = C6 = 0; 20..127 = -64..+43; 0..19
|     clamp to -64; a sample track keeps the stock 64 + 5 * (note - 84)),
|     stored as the PTCH lock byte FIRST (stock posts the START and stores
|     the byte after it: a frame between the two starts the voice on the
|     previous note's lock -- seen once in the emulator, with the START
|     before the engine knew the note), the note joins the track's
|     HELD-NOTE LIST (po_mheld, 8 notes in press order), its (identity,
|     raw) is queued in the track's RING (po_mring), its identity 0x80 |
|     note is posted as the track's live key (qz_pkey[t], KEYS_AT), and the
|     START goes last: the engine's START allocates one voice per queued note-on
|     (po_start: two note-ons inside one frame share one stock START), each
|     at its own pitch, with V_KEY = the identity, so po_start1's rules apply
|     as for a key -- "----": one voice a note, VOIC the polyphony (the
|     oldest is stolen), a repeated note-on for a sounding note absorbed; a
|     shape: chord memory (the new note's chord replaces the old one);
|   * po_moff at the note-off's compare 0x4000dfd4 (reached for a note
|     outside 72..96 through po_mogate at the note-off's own octave switch
|     0x4000de10, po_mgate's twin): the note leaves the
|     list; on a paraphonic synth track (Part VOIC 2..4, the keys' rule) only
|     the LAST note's release takes the stock block (mailbox |= 0x40: the
|     AMP release, as the last key's release does), an earlier one's does
|     nothing there -- the engine releases that note's voice (po_frame's
|     scan, and po_st_live for a note-off that beat its START); VOIC 1 (the
|     mono voice, the stock lifecycle) and every sample track: stock;
|   * po_mgate at the octave switch 0x4000e452: a note outside 72..96 whose
|     channel addresses a synth track goes to the chromatic block for the
|     channel's SYNTH tracks alone (the auto channel: the active track when
|     it is a synth); the STANDARD functions of notes 24..71 do not run for
|     such a message (a synth track's channel is a keyboard); a channel
|     without a synth track, and 72..96 on any channel: stock;
|   * po_mrec at the 0x41 event's live recorder 0x400625e0 (stock: the
|     active track only, while LIVE RECORDING): on a synth track the note
|     is handed to po_keyrec as a key of its own (identity 0x80 | note, raw
|     = note - 20) -- a JOINING note records no trig (the chord's step gets
|     PTCH / CHRD / VOIC), else the stock recorder places the trig and the
|     PTCH lock is the raw (stock wrote 5 * note - 356 there, a sample
|     track's units) and a new chord record starts; po_mtrig at the
|     trig-held branch 0x4006262a: the held trig's PTCH lock is the raw too.
| Velocity is ignored (stock keeps none for audio tracks). MIDI note OUT and
| the panel keys are untouched; a MIDI note gets no HOLD (note length) lock.
| FOLLOW TM with the CHROMATIC trig mode is a different path (0x400500e8 ->
| the key handler 0x4004fb94 with key = note - 72: the quantizer's 25-key
| paraphony, 72..96) and is not changed.

| (BUILD 37, 29 Sep 2026; po_rtlog's ring, root29w/run_f37a.log): a sequencer trig
| on a track whose voice still sounds is posted by the builder's own sequencer
| path (0x4000b906: the trig record's byte +62, then the OR-0x10 of 0x4000b9aa /
| 0x4000bd74 / 0x4000bdc0) as 0x10 | n -- the CF START bit 4 with the trig's
| sub-frame position n (measured cycling 4, 0xc, 5, 0xd, ... at 120 BPM: a step
| is 344.5 frames) and no bit 5; the packer splits the frame's render calls at n
| and the DSP crossfades its old voice under the new one for ~26 samples. Both
| are the engine's one continuous stream (sy_warm: the same oscillator carries
| on), so old + new = a +5.6 dB bump at every trig. The panel key's START (the
| raw mailbox word 0x1d of 0x40005030's raw-store exit) reaches the DSP as 0x30
| -- bits 4 and 5, nibble 0 -- and is clean (x1.00, the DIAG round's kwh take).
| THE FIX: on a synth track whose engine voice is on (S_ON != 0) every START byte
| (bit 4 or 5 set) becomes exactly the key's clean form 0x30 -- the CF START at
| the frame's first sample (the trig lands a frame boundary early, at most 15
| samples = 0.34 ms), the packer's calls [0,0) + [0,16), sy_render's START rule
| as before (HOLD re-armed, the index envelope restarted, the pitch snapped,
| warm: phase-continuous from the level reached). A silent synth track (S_ON 0)
| and every sample track keep stock's byte. po_rtlog counts the passes and the
| rewrites and rings the START bytes (the rig peeks it at po_clock + 32).

| ==== TRANSPOSING A HELD STEP: po_octave (4 Oct 2026) ==========================
| FUNC + UP / DOWN is the trig-mode selector (manual 12.7): both keys' records
| in the FUNC layer's table (0x400bf628, MKI 0x400bf2b4) name the handler
| 0x40051fc4(code, edge). The selector is a WINDOW: its handle is the long
| 0x400bebae (0 = closed). Closed, a press (edge 1) opens it through the
| pointer 0x400bebca (0x400586cc: 0x4005829c builds it, the handle is
| stored, its key layer registered with 0x40031494, the list drawn with the
| mode 0x460d16f0) and any other edge returns; open, a press or a repeat
| (edge 2) steps the mode (0x40051f54 UP for code 0x33, 0x40051ee4 DOWN for
| any other) and the handler chains to 0x400bebd2 (the window's redraw
| 0x400359ac). The hook sits at the handle test (0x40051fce: `tstl
| 0x400bebae; beqs 0x40051ff6`, d1 = the code, d0 = the edge, d2 pushed) and
| takes a press with the window CLOSED when a [TRIG] key is held for locking
| on a synth track in GRID RECORDING, in any trig mode -- the lock editor's
| own state: the held-trig mask 0x460d174a (a word, bit n = [TRIG n + 1],
| as the PTCH knob's editor 0x400508e4 walks it), the trig page's first
| step 0x460d174c, GRID RECORDING 0x460d1736. The trig mode 0x460d16f0 is
| NOT a gate (6 Oct 2026, Tim on hardware: CHROMATIC + a held trig + FUNC +
| DOWN opened the selector): in GRID RECORDING the [TRIG] keys edit steps
| whatever the mode, and the mask's writers (the press 0x40050f88.., the
| release 0x4005fbb2..) test the edit state 0x460d5db4 and the machine, not
| the mode. Every held step's PTCH lock (flat slot 0, the
| record's 0x59 + step * 32) moves 12 raw units = an octave in the synth's
| semitone PTCH, UP or DOWN, clamped 0..127 (-64..+63); a step without a
| lock (0xff) starts from the Part's PTCH and gets one. The store is the
| editor's (0x40050e60..): the byte in the bank's RAM record and in its
| battery-RAM mirror, the bank's changed flag (+635698) and 0x100f8598,
| 0x40027e00 after each step, then its tail -- 0x4009da20(track), 0x460d173a
| := 1, the six words 0x460d1a9e.. and 0x460d10dc cleared, 0x460d1750 := 1,
| 0x400418e0, the redraw 0x4004d948(-1), 0x40027de4 -- so the PLAYBACK page
| (the locks are shown while the trig is held) prints the new value at
| once; the handler then returns as it does for a release (0x40052006), the
| selector never opened. A repeat or a release with a trig held returns the
| same way (stock returns there too with the window closed): one press, one
| octave. The window open, no trig held, a sample track, or GRID RECORDING
| off: the displaced test and its branch, byte for byte the selector.

| ==== THE AMP SETUP PAGE'S SIXTH BOX: LEG (2 Oct 2026) =============================
| FUNC + AMP opens the AMP SETUP window (0x40059c8c): it stages the stock AMP
| descriptor's page 2 into its knob array (0x40059d56: `pea 0x400d3988; jsr
| 0x400326d4`, the enable nibbles decide which boxes take a knob), and its
| drawer 0x40036794 walks the six boxes with the names at 0x400d39c2 (P +
| 0x3a), the formatters at 0x400d3a6a (P + 0xca + 24, the widgets 48 bytes
| on) and the enable pair 0x400d3b12/16 (P + 0x18a/0x18e), all hard-coded --
| the resolver is not consulted, so the LFO page's trick (po_lfopage) does
| not reach it. The sixth box is p11 TRIG: named, five values, nibble 0 (not
| drawn, no knob), a Part byte behind it all the same (AMP_P2_OFF + track *
| 30 + 5, the page-2 editor 0x4003adec writes it, the shadow 0x100a51c6 +
| part * 6322 + track * 30 + 5 in battery RAM with it, and the live lane
| 0x8000083c + track * 72 + 5 -> the DSP record's AMP word 23, low byte,
| which sy_render zeroes for the DSP). Five detours (modules/synth/manifest.py),
| every one asking po_amp_desc for the descriptor: the CLONE for an audio
| current track (0x80000000: the window's and the editor's track) -- count 3
| (OFF / MONO / POLY) on a synth track, count 2 (OFF / MONO) on any other
| audio track since 3 Oct 2026 (po_amp_kind) -- and the stock record for the
| master track (track 7 with 0x80000034 set: its AMP page is another
| record's); the MIDI-mode pages never run this window:
|   * po_ampstage at 0x40059d56: the clone is staged (its nibble gives box 6
|     the F knob);
|   * po_ampdraw1 at 0x4003685a (the two leas), po_ampdraw2 at 0x400368ac
|     and po_ampdraw3 at 0x40036946 (the enable pair): the drawer reads the
|     clone's names, formatter, widget and nibbles;
|   * po_ampedit at 0x4003ae40, the page-2 editor's handler read (it reads
|     the STOCK record's handler, min and count -- count 5): slot 11 of an
|     audio track gets po_legknob, one value a detent, clamped 0..2 (synth)
|     or 0..1 (sample) by the handler itself (the editor's own clamp is 0..4).
| The clone (po_ampdesc_buf, built on first use from the stock record in the
| image, as po_lfodesc): slot 11 named LEG, formatter po_fmt_leg (OFF / MONO
| / POLY), widget LEG_WIDGET, default 0, nibble 1; its count is written on
| every hand-out (3 or 2, the current track's). The knob writes the Part
| byte through the stock editor, so SAVE, RELOAD, a warm boot and Part copy
| carry it as they carry every AMP page-2 byte.
|
| po_amp_kind: d2 = track -> d0 = 0 (the master track: the stock record), 2
| (an audio track: LEG OFF / MONO) or 3 (a synth track: OFF / MONO / POLY) --
| the clone's count for slot 11. Clobbers d0, d1, a0, a1; tst.l d0 done.

| ==== FINE DEFAULTS TO 0c WHEN A TRACK BECOMES A SYNTH TRACK (28 Sep 2026) =========
| Tim's report: a freshly assigned synth track came up with FINE +63c -- FINE is
| the stock RATE byte (PLAYBACK slot D; cents = raw - 64) and stock's RATE
| default is 127, so every Part, and every track that was a sample track, carries
| 127 there. The three stock sites that turn a track into a FLEX track of a given
| slot are detoured; at each, when the track IS a synth track after the write
| (machine FLEX, the FLEX column's slot a marker: po_slot_marker) and WAS NOT one
| before it (the machine was not FLEX, or the FLEX slot was not a marker), RATE
| := 64 is written into the Part's FLEX PLAYBACK bytes, their battery-RAM shadow
| and the live lane (po_fine_reset), so the page reads FINE 0c at once and SAVE
| keeps it. Nothing else is touched: a synth track's tuned FINE survives a
| re-assignment of the same or another marker slot, a project load, a Part
| reload, a pattern change and a warm boot (none of them run these sites); a
| sample track is never written (a non-marker slot is no synth track); RATE
| p-locks live in the pattern and are not read here.
|   * po_assign at 0x400795ba, in the slot assigner 0x40079424 (both windows'
|     apply paths call it when the slot differs): `addal #0x8f04a,%a0; moveb
|     %d1,%a0@` -- a0 = the Part's slot byte of the new machine (a3), d1 = the
|     new slot; the machine byte was written at 0x40079522 and the OLD machine
|     is the outermost of the three arguments still on the stack (0x4007956c:
|     old machine, track, part for 0x400972fc), 8(sp). The old slot of the new
|     machine's column is read before the displaced store.
|   * po_machwin at 0x40079816, the machine window's machine-only write
|     0x400797cc (the slot equal, the machine changed -- the assigner exits at
|     0x40079672 without writing): `addal #0x8eda2,%a0; mvsb %a0@,%d3` -- d3 :=
|     the old machine, d4 = the new one, d1 = the track; the FLEX column's slot
|     is the Part's (po_flex_slot).
|   * po_machlist at 0x4005a848, the sample-list window's machine-only write
|     0x4005a826, the same shape: `addal #0x8eda2,%a0; mvsb %a0@,%d4` -- d4 :=
|     the old machine, the new one at 0x460d5c30, d2 = the track.
| Not detoured: the paste of a copied track record (0x40027e4c kind 0, machine
| and slot with every page byte from the source, so FINE comes along) and the
| project / Part loaders (a saved Part keeps its bytes).

| touches the Part: the machine and the slot byte do not change, none of the
| three assigner sites runs, and the track has become a synth track by its
| slot's FILE changing. So the change of a FLEX slot's file is the fourth site:
| the slot's marker state is read before the path write and after it, and when
| it went non-marker (or empty) -> marker, every FLEX track whose FLEX slot is
| this slot became a synth track: RATE := 64 for each (po_fine_reset). A marker
| replaced by a marker changes nothing (its synth tracks keep their FINE), a
| marker replaced by a sample, a STATIC slot, a recorder buffer: nothing.

| ---- the chord shapes: CHRD raw >> 2 -> four semitone offsets, a VOICING ----
| 32 shapes in FOUR PASSES (OCTATRICK2.8, Tim's order after Elektron's
| Syntakt convention: the common chords first, the intervals last): row 0
| the single note; pass one the triads MIN MAJ SU2 SU4; pass two the
| sevenths and adds MI7 DO7 MA7 7S4 DI7 AD2 MD2 AD9 MI6 MA6; pass three the
| rest M75 DIM AUG MI9 DO9 MA9 M69 QUA; pass four the two-note intervals
| 4TH 5TH OCT 3MI 3MA 7MI 7MA (digit-first names) and the spreads MAS MIS.
| The notes of every row are the 2.7 table's; only the positions moved, so a
| CHRD byte saved by 2.7 or earlier (a knob setting, a lock) names another
| shape in 2.8 -- the row numbers below are 2.8's. The CHRD byte's low two
| bits are the INVERSION (26 Sep 2026: raw = shape << 2 | inversion, one a
| detent, so the knob walks MIN MIN1 MIN2 MIN3 MAJ ...; a knob-set byte of an
| older pattern has 0 there = the root position). Every shape but "----"
| has FOUR notes in PRIORITY ORDER: the shape's own notes first -- the root,
| then the note that names the shape (the 7th of a MA7, the 6th of a MA6,
| the b5 of a DIM, the 9th of an AD9, the 2nd of an AD2), then the 3rd,
| then the 5th; the ninths keep their 7th before the 3rd (a 9th chord at
| VOIC 3 is root, 9th, 7th) -- then octave doublings until four. The engine
| plays the VOICING of (shape, inversion) for VOIC notes (po_voicing: the
| notes by pitch, rotated so the inversion's note is the bass = PTCH, the
| notes below it an octave up, the doublings octaves of the rotated notes,
| then the VOIC notes of the highest priority), so VOIC 2 plays two notes of
| every shape, VOIC 3 three, VOIC 4 four; the recogniser tries every (shape,
| inversion) voicing against the played keys (po_match: among equal
| voicings the shape with the FEWEST distinct notes wins, then table order
| -- C F is 4TH, not SU4's first two notes). "----" is the one note
| (SHAPE_END after it) and VOIC is the keyboard polyphony there. Nothing
| else reads a shape in order: po_snap snaps each note alone, the CHRD
| formatter prints the name and the inversion.
