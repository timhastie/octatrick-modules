| SYNTH MACHINE -- the FM voice engine as a DRAM unit, phase 5: paraphonic
| chords (24 Sep 2026). GNU as, -mcpu=5475. Linked by the build into the
| platform runtime at the base of the arena reserve (docs/remixer/
| PLACEMENT.md); the kind table's FLEX entry 0x400d6438 is pointed at
| sy_render by a "ptr" detour (modules/synth/manifest.py). synth.s, the ROM
| cave this grew out of, is kept beside it for the record: everything under
| "the mono voice" below is that cave's code, and at VOIC 1 the samples it
| produces are the same, bit for bit.
|
| WHAT (phases 1-4, unchanged): a FLEX track whose sample is named SYNTH* has
| its sample data GENERATED here every frame instead of taken from the flex
| pool -- a two-operator FM voice at the final pitch, 16 samples a frame at
| rate 1.0 (the DSP's resampler is an identity), carrier = sin(phi_c + I *
| sin(phi_m + fb * m_prev)); the PLAYBACK page's other slots are RATIO
| (STRT), INDEX (LEN), FEEDBACK (RTRG), DECAY (RTIM); PTCH and RATE go
| through the stock renderer's own rate arithmetic; GLIDE (the project
| setting at GLIDE_AT) slews the pitch. The stock renderer is still called
| around every frame (the voice lifecycle, streaming and the record's
| headers are its), with PTCH := 0 and RATE := 1.0 for the call.
|
| PARAPHONIC (phase 5). VOIC, the LFO page's slot 2 on a synth track (SPD3's
| byte, the page names it VOIC: 1..4, a stock or out-of-range byte reads 1),
| is the switch: at 1 the track is the mono synth of phase 4 (this file's
| mono path, GLIDE legato, the stock voice lifecycle, bit for bit); at 2..4
| a voice START makes the track paraphonic (T_POLY, latched per note): that
| many voices, each with its own phases, index envelope, slewed pitch and
| amplitude envelope, summed into the track's one source stream at half
| level with saturation:
|   * a voice START (the packer's event bit 4: a sequencer trig or a live
|     CHROMATIC key) allocates one voice per note of the CHORD SHAPE --
|     the track's LFO page slot 5 byte (DEP3's storage, the "current value"
|     byte 0x80000810 + t*72 + 11, so a step lock on that slot picks the
|     shape per step), 0..127 -> po_shapes[raw >> 2], 32 shapes of up to
|     four semitone offsets -- at the record's PTCH word plus the offset,
|     each note snapped onto the quantizer's SCALE when one is set (po_snap:
|     the mask through the pinned accessor SCALE_AT, nearest degree, ties
|     down -- a MAJ shape in a minor scale comes out MIN). VOIC (current
|     value 0x80000810 + t*72 + 8, locks honoured) caps the notes a trig
|     takes at 2..4 -- the root first, dropped from the top;
|     A free voice is taken first, else the oldest releasing one, else the
|     oldest sounding one (a global allocation stamp, V_AGE);
|   * a live key (the quantizer's key hooks leave the key's index+1 in
|     qz_pkey[t] at KEYS_AT and keep the mask of held keys in qz_pmask[t])
|     tags its voices with the key; releasing the key (its bit leaves the
|     mask) puts them into RELEASE. A sequencer trig (qz_pkey[t] == 0)
|     first releases every sounding voice of the track: notes sustain
|     until the next trig;
|   * RELEASE: the voice's gain decays exponentially with the time constant
|     of the AMP page REL byte (0x80000810 + t*72 + 14, locks applied):
|     tau = 5 ms * 1000^(rel/126) -- 5 ms at 0, 29 ms at 32, 167 ms at 64,
|     0.97 s at 96, 5 s at 126; 127 = INF (the DSP's INF), the voice
|     sustains until stolen (po_relk). Attack is the same 8-frame ramp the
|     mono voice has;
|   * PITCH per voice: target = V_ROOT + (PTCH word - the word at the last
|     start), so a lock or slide or LFO on PTCH moves every voice by the
|     same interval (and each voice slews it with GLIDE, sy_slew on its own
|     V_CUR) while a new key's word does not move the voices already
|     sounding (V_ROOT absorbs the delta at each start). The word is folded
|     into the stock curve's 24-semitone range by octaves before the rate
|     arithmetic and the increment shifted back, so a chord note up to three
|     octaves above PTCH +12 keeps the stock's tuning;
|   * LEVEL: each voice is c * gain with gain Q14 (1/2 of the mono voice's
|     0x4000 full scale), the sum doubled into the mono format's Q15 and
|     saturated at +-0x7fff: one note is 6 dB below the mono voice, four in
|     phase reach full scale.
| The stock voice lifecycle is untouched: a new key restarts the DSP voice
| (the AMP and filter envelopes run over the whole mix as for a sample), a
| released last key posts the AMP release as stock. Musically: AMP ATK 0,
| HOLD INF, REL to taste -- the per-voice envelopes shape the notes.
|
| ALSO HERE: po_lfo3 / po_lfo3b (detours at the depth read of the LFO engine's
| two copies, 0x40003ca4 and 0x4000d03e: LFO 3's depth is read as 0 on a track
| whose playing voice is a synth, whatever VOIC -- its slots are VOIC and CHRD
| there, and LFO 3's default PMTR is PTCH, so a chord byte read as its depth
| was a pitch LFO: the same key gave a different pitch each press) and
| po_lfopage (a detour at the page resolver's LFO-descriptor load 0x40031e62:
| every synth track gets a clone of the LFO descriptor built here on first
| use, slot 2 named VOIC printing 1..4 with that range and default 1, slot 5
| named CHRD printing the shape's name, or "----" while VOIC is 1), and
| po_pgdesc (26 Sep 2026: the FM SYNTH PLAYBACK descriptor page.s returns is
| built here too, on first use, from the stock FLEX record in the image plus
| page.s's overrides -- the pinned page cave carries no stock bytes; page.s
| reaches the builder through the pointer word published before sy_render).
|
| Layout: the page clone's accessor word, code, then the tables (ratio,
| shapes, names, po_relk, the sine table) and the RAM state (per-track
| records, 32 voice records, the LFO and PLAYBACK descriptor clones). The
| main OS runs from DRAM and so does this.

| ==== po_pgdesc(a1 = page.s's patch list) -> d0 = the FM SYNTH PLAYBACK descriptor ==
| Called by page.s's pg_resolve (the resolver's PLAYBACK-page detour, a UI-task
| path: the resolver 0x40031da4 serves the page renderer, the footer and the
| knob handler, never the audio interrupt) through the pointer word before
| sy_render, for a FLEX track whose sample is named SYNTH*. The clone is
| built on first use: the stock FLEX PLAYBACK descriptor (FLEX_P, 402 B, read
| from the OS image in DRAM, never written) is copied into po_pgdesc_buf,
| this unit's own RAM, and page.s's overrides are applied over the copy --
| {offset.w, length.w, source.l} records, a negative offset ending the list:
| the title, the four synth slot names, the formatter and widget pointers
| into the pinned page cave, the enable nibbles. page.s owns the layout;
| this routine only copies. The built flag and the buffer are runtime data,
| depacked as zeros by the loader at every boot, so a power cycle rebuilds
| the clone (the LFO page's po_lfodesc works the same way). The repository
| carries none of the record's stock bytes. Clobbers d0/d1/a0/a1 only.
