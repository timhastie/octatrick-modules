| DIRECT JUMP -- ColdFire code cave (13 Sep 2026; 24 Sep 2026: index 1). GNU as,
| -mcpu=5475.
|
| CHAIN AFTER's value 1 -- the stock list's unused "1 step" (its setter skips it,
| its loader bumps a saved 1 to 2) -- becomes DIRECT: a pattern selected while
| the sequencer runs starts at the NEXT STEP, at the step count the old pattern
| had reached, instead of at the old pattern's end. Everything below rides the
| firmware's own arranger mechanism -- a queued pattern carries a START STEP
| (0x80006630) and the tick handler carries an absolute CHANGE-AT step
| (0x8000662c) -- so the switch itself (part, per-track positions, LEDs, UI
| notices) is stock code. Every other reader of CHAIN AFTER sees DIRECT as
| PAT.LEN because the manifest pokes the stock step table's entry 1 (0x400d80e0)
| from 1 to -1; the label table's entry 1 (0x400b27ec) becomes stock's own
| "DIRECT" string. No relocated tables, no widened clamps (the 13 Sep build put
| DIRECT at an 18th index and carried both tables and six clamp pokes).
|
| Position independent: OS absolutes and pc-relative references only.
|
| Layout (fixed with .org; the manifest's OFF_* constants are these):
|   +0x000 dj_queue   hook target, jsr planted at 0x400a06d6 (the setter's
|                     "transport running" branch), 12 bytes displaced
|   +0x100 dj_apply   hook target, jsr planted at 0x400a44e2 (the tick
|                     handler's boundary apply), 18 bytes displaced
|
| Sequencer state (docs/firmware/RTOS_FORK.md 8.3, and this module's README):
|   0x800065bd/be  playing bank / pattern      0x800065bf/c0  queued bank / pattern
|   0x800065b2     step counter (word)          0x800065b6     tick 0..5 within the step
|   0x80006630     start step of the queued pattern (the arranger's OFFSET)
|   0x80006634     its change-at (-1 = PAT.LEN)  0x8000662c     the PLAYING pattern's change-at
|   0x8000004e     project CHAIN AFTER index; pattern+0x8e56 = the pattern's own (bit 7: use project)
|   0x460d1aec     arranger playing (0x40033968 returns it)

| ---- dj_queue: the setter 0x400a0570, transport running ---------------------
| Registers here (read off the setter): d4 = bank, d5 = pattern, d3 = start
| step (0 from every UI path), d2 = change-at (-1 from every UI path; the
| arranger passes its row length), d6 = arg 5. After the hook the setter
| stores d3 to 0x80006630/0x80006638 and d2 (-1) to 0x80006634, then
| rewrites d0. So: set d3 and the tick handler's change-at, touch nothing
| else. d1/a0 are saved; d0 is the setter's scratch.

| ---- dj_apply: the tick handler 0x400a3fdc, boundary apply ------------------
| Right after the playing pair took the queued pair (0x400a44d0). The three
| displaced longword moves latch the start step for the per-track maths
| that follows (0x400a47f6..); 0x8000662c is latched from 0x80006634 AFTER
| this hook (0x400a44f4), so it still holds our trigger here. Only d0 is
| free (reloaded at 0x400a4508 / 0x400a456e); everything else is preserved.
