"""DIRECT JUMP -- CHAIN AFTER's value 1 becomes DIRECT: a pattern selected
while the sequencer runs starts at the next step, at the step count the
old pattern had reached (the Analog Four / Rytm behaviour), instead of at
the old pattern's end or after its CHAIN AFTER length. Off by default:
the value is an existing, unused position of an existing project setting,
so a project that never selects it plays exactly as stock.

WHERE THE OPTION LIVES, AND WHY. The Octatrack's own "change length" is
CHAIN AFTER -- PROJECT > CONTROL > SEQUENCER, the LEVEL knob steps it
through PAT.LEN, 2/16 .. 256/16 -- stored as one byte (0x8000004e, mirror
0x100b14ae, 0..16 indexing the step table at 0x400d80dc: -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
8 .. 256) and written to the project file as PATTERN_CHANGE_CHAIN_BEHAVIOR=<n>.
INDEX 1 ("1 step") IS UNUSED BY STOCK: the menu setter skips it in the
direction of travel (0x40065a22..2a: a result of 1 becomes delta + 1, i.e.
2 or 0), the project loader bumps a saved 1 to 2 (0x40087820..38, after its
0..16 clamp at 0x4008780c/12), and the UI mirror's sanitiser (0x40010212..38)
only clamps 0..16. So DIRECT takes index 1 (24 Sep 2026; the 13 Sep build
used an 18th index, which needed two relocated 18-entry tables, eight `lea`
repoints and six widened clamps): the setter's skip and the loader's bump
become plain branches (two 2-byte pokes), the stock step table's entry 1
(0x400d80e0) becomes -1 so every stock reader -- the tick handler
(0x400a4154/0x400a4310), the chain advance, PATTERN SETTINGS' "exceeds the
pattern" blink (0x4006e85c, 0x40081c60, 0x40081fb2, 0x40082726), the
countdown/LED page (0x400a29c2, 0x400a3668) -- treats DIRECT as PAT.LEN,
and the label table's entry 1 (0x400b27ec) points at stock's own "DIRECT"
string (0x400b6912). The menu reads PAT.LEN, DIRECT, 2/16, 3/16 .. 256/16.

WHAT ELSE TREATS INDEX 1 SPECIALLY (checked, unchanged): the PATTERN
SETTINGS per-pattern CHAIN BEHAVIOR setter (0x40081d74..0x40081e30) skips
1 the same way and shows its own label tables (0x400b2fae PLEN/1/16/..,
0x400b2f52 and 0x400b2ff2 TR.LEN/1/16/..), so DIRECT stays a PROJECT-level
choice: a pattern on USE PAT SET. keeps its own length, one on USE PRJ SET.
(byte +0x8e56 < 0) follows the project. The MIDI program-change path
(0x4000dada), the [PATTERN]/[BANK] + [TRIG] keys (0x40056b68, 0x40055f84),
the arranger (0x4004a652, with its row's absolute change-at) all reach the
same setter 0x400a0570 that dj_queue hooks; none reads the index itself.
MIGRATION: a project saved by the 13 Sep build (PATTERN_CHANGE_CHAIN_BEHAVIOR
=17) loads as 256/16 through the stock clamp; a stock unit loads a project
saved with DIRECT (=1) as 2/16 through its own bump.

THE SEQUENCER SIDE, from the disassembly (all measured in ot_emu, README):
  * a pattern selected while playing goes 0x40056b30 ([PATTERN]+[TRIG]) ->
    0x400a1030(bank, pattern) -> the setter 0x400a0570 with (start step 0,
    change-at -1), whose transport-running branch at 0x400a06d6 stores the
    QUEUED pair 0x800065bf/c0, the start step to 0x80006630 and the change-at
    to 0x80006634 -- the arranger's OFFSET / LENGTH mechanism, shared;
  * the tick handler (0x400a3fdc) at tick 0 of every step increments the
    step counter 0x800065b2 and switches when the counter reaches the
    playing pattern's end (0x400a4388), its CHAIN AFTER multiple
    (0x400a4352, table 0x400d80dc[idx]) or the absolute change-at
    0x8000662c (0x400a439a); the apply block then takes the queued pair
    (0x400a44d0) and positions every track from 0x80006630 (0x400a44e2..).
  * DIRECT is therefore two hooks and no new mechanism: dj_queue (at
    0x400a06d6) sets change-at := counter + 1 and start step := that count
    wrapped to the new pattern's length; dj_apply (at 0x400a44e2) clears
    the start step once it has been latched so later restarts begin at 0
    as stock, and sends the MIDI program change stock would have sent two
    ticks earlier if the selection came after that tick.

MEASURED (README): stock and the remix with CHAIN AFTER = PAT.LEN switch
at the pattern end, byte-identical sequencer traces; with DIRECT the
switch lands at the next step and the step counter continues; the value
survives SAVE PROJECT + a cold boot on the persistent card. Flashed as
OCTATRICK1/2/3 in its 18th-index form (23 Sep 2026); the index-1 form is
verified in the emulator only.
