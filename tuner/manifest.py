"""TUNER -- a guitar-tuner readout of the current audio track.

UP held + TEMPO opens a window (the TEMPO window's class, so the two
evict each other) that prints the note, octave, cents and a needle for
whatever the current audio track is playing, post-FX pre-fader, from the
read-back arena the USB AUDIO producer reads too. TEMPO alone, FUNC +
TEMPO (tap tempo) and UP alone stay stock; the window closes with TEMPO,
YES, NO or UP + TEMPO again, the stock TEMPO window's keys.

A DRAM unit (tuner.s) with three detours: the TEMPO opener's first
instruction (the chord), frame_isr's tail (16 mono samples a block into a
4,096-sample ring while the window is open, nothing when it is closed),
and the UI task's loop head (the analysis and the redraw, ~7 times a
second, in the UI task, never in the interrupt). The detector is McLeod's
normalised square difference at 11,025 Hz refined by the YIN difference
at 44,100 Hz, integer only (no EMAC). README.md has what was measured.
