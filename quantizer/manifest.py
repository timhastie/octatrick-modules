"""SCALE QUANTIZER -- a per-project SCALE setting (OFF plus 24 scales) that
quantizes the audio tracks' pitch, as the Digitakt / Digitone do. With a
scale on, the PTCH knob on the PLAYBACK page steps to the next scale degree
in the turn direction instead of one raw unit (from 0 up in PHRYGIAN: 1, 3,
5, 7, 8, 10, 12 ...; below the root the same degrees an octave down), and a
[TRIG] key in CHROMATIC trig mode snaps to the nearest degree (ties to the
lower) before it becomes the pitch the voice, the lock and the screen see.
OFF is stock: every detour replays what it displaced.

WHERE THE SETTING LIVES. PROJECT > CONTROL > SEQUENCER gains a fourth row,
SCALE, under CHAIN AFTER / SILENCE TRACKS / LFO AUTO CHANGE: the window is a
generic list (state 0x460e43d8, init 0x40065c7c, draw 0x40065b14, keys
0x40065cec, LEVEL knob 0x40065c98) over three parallel pointer tables --
labels 0x400b27d0, getters 0x400b27dc, setters 0x400b282c -- which the
build grows to four entries (TableGrow) and repoints. The list is created
with count 3 / visible 3 (`pea 3; pea 3` at 0x40065c7c); the count becomes
4 (poke) and the three visible rows scroll, as the firmware's longer lists
do, once the draw loop indexes the tables from the scroll offset instead of
0 (qz_draw). The value byte lives in the unit (qz_scale), OFF in the image.

PERSISTENCE. The project file is text (project.work, KEY=value lines); the
loader 0x400866c4 is a strcmp chain that REJECTS an unknown key (0x40086d3a,
error -51), but skips any line starting with '#' at 0x400867a2 before the
chain -- on stock firmware too. So the setting is written as
"#SEQUENCER_SCALE=n" right after PATTERN_CHANGE_CHAIN_BEHAVIOR (qz_wr,
in the writer 0x40088882..), read back by a detour on the '#' check
(qz_ld_line), and reset to OFF at the start of every storing load
(qz_ld_entry; the loader's parse-only pass leaves it alone). A stock unit
loads such a project unchanged. Every path that writes a project file goes
through that one serializer 0x40088288 (SYNC TO CARD and SAVE write
project.work with it, 0x4008fe40; SAVE then copies .work to .strd file by
file, 0x4008ee74; RELOAD copies .strd back and loads it, 0x4008f180) and
every path that reads one goes through that one loader (0x4009000c, a
parse-only pass then a storing pass, both on project.work).

WHERE THE VALUE LIVES (26 Sep 2026, Tim's MKI report: SAVE, power off, SCALE
and GLIDE gone). A POWER CYCLE READS NO PROJECT FILE. The unit comes back
from its battery-backed RAM (CS1, 0x10000000..): the boot (0x4001fb3c..)
sanitises the settings block 0x100b1480..0x100b14e1 (0x4000fec8) and
memcpy's it to the live copy 0x80000000.. (CHAIN AFTER 0x8000004e <-
0x100b14ae, the mirror every setter writes); project.work is read only by
PROJECT > CHANGE and RELOAD -- which is why the emulator, whose RAM is
empty at every start and whose rig loads the project through the loader,
never showed it. Until then the two bytes lived in the OS image (this unit
and the pinned glide.s), copied fresh from flash at every boot: OFF. Now the
setting IS a battery byte -- SCALE at 0x100b14ec, GLIDE at 0x100b14ed, the
linker's padding between the block's last long 0x100b14de..e1 and the
16-byte-aligned project record 0x100b14f0 (no reference in the OS, outside
both memcpy'd blocks, never written by stock in a boot + load + play + SAVE
+ SYNC session under watchmem) -- read and written in place, clamped at boot
where stock clamps its own bytes (qz_boot, a jsr at 0x40010212 in the
sanitiser, garbage -> OFF) and set to OFF with the block by the project
defaults (qz_defaults, a jsr at 0x40025ac2 in 0x40025848: a cold boot, a
boot with no project, the loader before its storing pass, a new project).
The synth engine reads GLIDE at the same address (GLIDE_AT).

THE KNOB. 0x40055008(slot, delta) resolves the Part byte, calls the slot's
own handler (PTCH: 0x40032d08, a fractional accumulator), clamps to the
descriptor's [min, min+count-1] and stores at 0x40055170 -- the hook. A
turn with a [TRIG] key held never reaches it: the p-lock editor (the store
at 0x40050e60, found with ot_emu's watchmem) starts from the step's lock
byte, or the Part's value when there is none, and writes the lock and its
SRAM mirror; it is hooked the same way, with the same rule. With
a scale on, for slot A of a kind-0 (PLAYBACK) page whose slot A is named
"PTCH" (STATIC 0x400d301c, FLEX 0x400d31ae, PICKUP 0x400d3664; THRU and
NEIGHBOR have no PTCH), the stored value is recomputed from the value the
knob was turned from: |delta| steps to the next raw on a scale semitone
(raw = 64 + 5 * semitones, 4..124; a value between degrees -- set with the
scale off, or a fraction -- snaps to the nearest degree in the turn
direction), unchanged at the ends, which is the stock clamp. The screen,
the SRAM mirror, a held trig's lock (0x40042158) and the MIDI CC echo all
take the stored value after the hook. RATE (slot D) is a playback rate
(-63..+63 per the manual, 0 = stopped, negative = backwards), not a
semitone quantity, and is left alone.

CHROMATIC. 0x4004fb94(track, key index 0..24, press) turns the index into
the raw pitch at 0x4004fc58 (`lea (4,%a2,%a2.l*4),%a2` = 5*idx + 4, root =
index 12 = TRIG 13), writes it as the lock byte 0x46c7dfda + t*32, trigs the
voice (0x40005030 / 0x46c80354) and, in LIVE RECORDING or with a trig held,
records it as the trig's PTCH lock (0x40042158 with a2). The detour snaps
the index before the lea. The MIDI note the key sends stays the key's own
(it is matched on release).

GLIDE (24 Sep 2026). A fifth SEQUENCER row, GLIDE: OFF / 1..127, the synth
machine's glide time (modules/synth/synth.s slews a synth voice's PTCH word
toward its target with a first-order lag, 10 ms at 1 .. 1 s at 127), saved
as "#SYNTH_GLIDE=n" after the SCALE line by the same writer and loader
detours (a storing load starts from OFF). The byte, qz_glide, is a battery
RAM byte at GLIDE_AT (see PERSISTENCE) because the synth engine reads it as
an absolute too; this unit reaches it through one accessor (qz_glide_of).
THE LEG GATE (2 Oct 2026): what a CHROMATIC key pressed while another key of
the track is held does is the synth track's LEG setting -- OFF / MONO / POLY
on the AMP SETUP page's sixth box, a Part byte saved with the project
(modules/synth) -- read through the engine's po_legmode (its pointer block,
-24 of sy_render; qz_legmode). Two jmp detours in the key handler 0x4004fb94
(qz_leg1 at 0x4004fbfe, qz_leg2 at 0x4004fc94): mono legato (VOIC 1, LEG
MONO or POLY) takes the stock's FUNC + key trigless path -- no voice
restart, no envelope retrigger, the pitch changes and glides over GLIDE --
suppresses the old key's voice note-off (its MIDI note-off still goes out)
and makes the new key the held key: releasing the first key does nothing,
releasing the last releases the note (the 303 rule); LEG OFF, FUNC held, a
release or nothing held: stock, byte for byte, and a sample track is stock
(until 2 Oct 2026 GLIDE != 0 was the legato switch, on any audio track;
GLIDE is the slide time only now).

PARAPHONIC KEYS (24 Sep 2026). On a FLEX track whose assigned slot holds a
SYNTH* sample and whose Part's VOIC byte (the synth's LFO page slot 2, 2..4
= paraphonic, modules/synth/poly.s) says so, the CHROMATIC keys are
polyphonic: a third detour on the handler's release path (qz_leg0,
0x4004fbde) and the two legato detours keep a per-track held-key mask and
post each key for the engine (keys.s, pinned at KEYS_AT: qz_pkey, qz_pmask);
a press ends nothing, a release ends only its own key, the last release
takes the stock note-off path. With LEG POLY the keys are legato here too
(paraphonic legato): the key joins the held set, the engine is told through
po_legkey (the block's -28) and the trigless path follows -- the sounding
chord slides to the key's voicing, "----" the newest voice (poly.s
po_handover); VOIC 1 and every other track are stock. A fourth detour,
qz_leg3 at 0x4004fce0, makes the LIVE RECORDER record a legato press (mono
or paraphonic) as a
trigless trig with its PTCH lock, as FUNC + key does, so playback slides
too (the OCTATRICK6 report); everything else records as stock. A fifth,
qz_leg4 at 0x4004fd06, notes the step a press recorded and the engine's tick
count; the key's release (or the stock note-off that ends it) writes the
played length as the step's HOLD lock through the stock writer 0x40042158
(flat slot 13), a legato chain getting its whole length on every step (the
OCTATRICK7 report). The synth
snaps chord notes onto SCALE through qz_scale_mask, reached by the six-byte
trampoline scale.s pinned at SCALE_AT.

THE TUNING SYSTEM (27 Sep 2026, synth tracks only; modules/synth gives the
synth page's PTCH the range -64..+63 at one raw unit a semitone and turns
RATE into FINE). This unit follows: qz_quant steps PTCH by scale degree over
raw = 64 + semitones on a synth track (qz_pcof), qz_chrom turns a key into
raw = 64 + (key - 12) + 12 * octave with the octave qz_oct, -4..+4, stepped
by FUNC + LEFT / RIGHT (qz_octkey at 0x40045918) while stock's 0/1 octave
word is held at 0 on such a track (qz_keyidx at the handler's caller
0x40050254, qz_octdraw in the drawer 0x40044968) and the number beside the
keyboard prints qz_oct (qz_octnum, 0x400449b8, stock's "%d"). MIDI IN on
a synth track is modules/synth's (30 Sep 2026: its po_mon at the block's
START 0x4000e746 replaced this module's qz_midi at 0x4000e74c). Sample tracks: the displaced
instructions, byte for byte.

Verified in ot_emu through the virtual panel (README);
flashed as OCTATRICK9 on an MKI, 26 Sep 2026 (emulator-verified since).
