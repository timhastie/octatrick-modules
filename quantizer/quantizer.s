| SCALE QUANTIZER -- ColdFire unit (13 Sep 2026). GNU as, -mcpu=5475.
|
| A per-project SCALE setting (PROJECT > CONTROL > SEQUENCER, fourth row,
| OFF by default) and three places it acts:
|   * the PTCH knob on the PLAYBACK page (STATIC / FLEX / PICKUP -- any page
|     of kind 0 whose slot A is named "PTCH") steps to the next scale degree
|     instead of one raw unit (raw = 64 + 5 * semitones, 4..124), on the
|     Part's value and, with a [TRIG] key held, on the step's lock;
|   * a [TRIG] key in CHROMATIC trig mode snaps to the nearest degree (ties
|     to the lower one) before the key becomes a pitch, so the voice, the
|     PTCH lock a held or live-recorded trig receives and the box on the
|     screen all carry the snapped value;
|   * the setting rides the project file as a comment line the stock loader
|     skips ("#SEQUENCER_SCALE=n" after PATTERN_CHANGE_CHAIN_BEHAVIOR).
| With SCALE = OFF every detour replays what it displaced and does nothing
| else; the setting byte lives in this unit (the main OS runs from DRAM).
|
| GLIDE (24 Sep 2026): a fifth SEQUENCER row, OFF / 1..127, the synth
| machine's glide time (modules/synth: 10 ms at 1 .. 1 s at 127), saved as
| "#SYNTH_GLIDE=n" after the SCALE line. The byte is qz_glide, pinned at a
| fixed address in glide.s (the synth cave reads it as an OS absolute); this
| unit reaches it by symbol, through qz_glide_of -- the ONE reader, so the
| storage can move. With GLIDE on, a CHROMATIC key pressed while another key
| of the track is held is a LEGATO note: the stock's trigless-trig path
| (the FUNC + key path) is taken, so the voice is not restarted and only the
| pitch changes (the synth glides to it), the old key's voice note-off is
| suppressed, and the new key becomes the track's held key, so releasing the
| first key does nothing and releasing the last one releases the note (the
| 303 rule). Two more detours in the chromatic key handler, qz_leg1 / qz_leg2.
|
| PARAPHONIC KEYS (24 Sep 2026): on a FLEX track whose assigned slot is a
| SYNTH* sample (qz_is_synth) and whose Part's VOIC byte -- the LFO page's
| slot 2, SPD3's byte, which the synth's page names VOIC -- is 2..4
| (qz_polytrack), the CHROMATIC keys are polyphonic: a press while keys are
| held starts a fresh voice and ends nothing (qz_leg1); every press posts the
| key for the engine (qz_pkey) and sets its bit in the track's held-key mask
| (qz_pmask, keys.s); a release clears the bit -- the engine releases that
| key's voices -- sends the key's MIDI note-off, and only the LAST key's
| release takes the stock note-off path, which posts the track's AMP release
| (qz_leg0, a third detour on the handler's release path). Legato is off on
| such a track. VOIC 1 (or a byte outside 1..4, the stock 32) and every
| other track: stock, byte for byte -- the mono synth with GLIDE legato.
|
| Linked by the build at the address it lands on (modules/quantizer/
| manifest.py names the sites); the only absolute references to itself are
| the qz_names entries, which the linker resolves.

| the press path is about to turn the index into the raw pitch (5 * idx + 4)

| ---- GLIDE legato: two jmp detours in the same handler --------------------------
| 0x4004fb94 keeps ONE held key per track (HELD + track = key + 1). Stock, a
| press while a key is held first ends that key -- 0x4004fbfe..0x4004fc40: the
| voice note-off (mailbox 0x46c80354[track] |= 0x40, which the frame builder
| turns into the AMP release, 0x4000b4e4), the MIDI note-off (key + 71) and
| held := 0 -- and then starts a new voice (0x4004fcb2: 0x40005030, cmd 0x1d,
| bit 2 = start); a release of a key that is not the held one does nothing
| (0x4004fbe6). With FUNC held (FUNC_HELD) stock skips the note-off and posts
| a TRIGLESS trig instead (0x4004fc9c: mailbox |= 0x119, no bit 2: the staged
| PTCH lock 0x46c7dfda + track*32 is applied at the next frame, 0x4000b75c,
| and the voice is not restarted -- 0x4000b5a8 starts one only on bit 2).
|
| With GLIDE on, a press while a key is held takes that trigless path without
| FUNC: the old key's MIDI note-off goes out as stock, the voice note-off does
| not, and the NEW key becomes the held key (releasing the first key does
| nothing, releasing the last one releases the note as stock). GLIDE off, FUNC
| held, a release, or nothing held: stock, byte for byte.
