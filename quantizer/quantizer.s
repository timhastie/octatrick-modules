| SCALE QUANTIZER -- the DRAM unit (13 Sep 2026; a DRAM unit since 28 Sep 2026). GNU as.
|
| OCTATRICK 2.9 (28 Sep 2026): ROOT, and the move into DRAM.
|   * ROOT: a fifth SEQUENCER row, right under SCALE (GLIDE is the sixth
|     now): C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B, the root the scale is
|     built on, a battery-RAM byte (NV_ROOT 0x100b14ee, beside SCALE and
|     GLIDE; core.s clamps it 0..11 at boot and sets C with the defaults),
|     saved as "#SEQUENCER_ROOT=n" after the SCALE line. Every snap this unit
|     does -- the PTCH knob, a PTCH lock, a CHROMATIC key -- and the chord
|     snap the synth engine does through SCALE_AT read ONE mask, core.s's
|     qz_scale_mask: the scale's pitch classes rotated by ROOT, so "MINOR,
|     ROOT A" is the A minor pitch classes on the C-based pitch class of
|     every note (raw 64 = C on a synth track, raw 64 = 0 st on a sample
|     track). With a scale on, the CHROMATIC keyboard is transposed so that
|     key 1 sounds the root: a synth track's key is n = key - 12 + ROOT +
|     12 * octave (so [TRIG 13] at octave 0 is the root an octave above key
|     1), a sample track's index is key + ROOT clamped at 24 (= +12 st, the
|     stock ceiling); the number beside the keyboard reads "A -1" where it
|     read "-1" (qz_octnum: the root's name is written into the format the
|     stock printer is handed). ROOT = C is 2.8 in every path -- the pitches,
|     the knob and the locks byte for byte, the keyboard's number reading
|     "C 0" where 2.8 read "0" with a scale on -- and SCALE = OFF ignores
|     ROOT altogether (every path leaves at its OFF test before ROOT is
|     read).
|   * THE SAMPLE TRACK'S TWO POSITIONS (the second pass). Stock lays the 16
|     keys over index 0..24 (-12..+12 st, TRIG 13 = index 12 = the sample's
|     own pitch) in two positions of ONE word, OCT_WORD (0 at boot; FUNC +
|     LEFT / RIGHT eor it): position 0 = index key-1 (keys 1..16 = -12..+3
|     st, the 16-key picture), position 1 = index key+11 (keys 1..13 = 0..+12
|     st; keys 14..16 fail the handler's range check, the 13-key picture).
|     With ROOT r > 0 only ONE complete root-to-root octave fits the stock
|     range, r-12 .. r: position 0 plays it (key 1 = the root below the
|     sample's pitch, key 13 = the root above, keys 14..16 = r+1 .. r+3,
|     clamped at +12 for A# / B only). Position 1 is necessarily partial: for
|     r <= 6 it is r .. r+12 with the top r keys clamped at +12 st (as the
|     first pass did for every root); for r > 6 (G .. B) the whole keyboard
|     drops two octaves there, r-24 .. r-12, and only the bottom 12 - r keys
|     clamp at -12 st -- the side that clamps FEWER keys. The number beside
|     the keyboard reads the position as an octave: "A 0" in position 0,
|     "A -1" in position 1 with r > 6, "D 1" with r <= 6 (qz_octnum). ROOT C
|     is stock's two positions exactly. The MIDI note a key sends out stays the
|     key's own (72 + key), as in 2.8 -- it never followed the octave either.
|   * DRAM: this unit is Linked(dram=True) -- linked into octabam's platform
|     runtime at the bottom of the audio page arena with the synth's poly.s,
|     depacked by the loader at the boot redirect 0x4000050c (before the
|     .data copy 0x4000f938 and main 0x40000db0, so before every detour site
|     of this unit can run; measured under the port with --watch-pc, README).
|     The OS image keeps only core.s (qz_boot, qz_defaults, qz_scale_mask,
|     the mask table: ~150 B) and the two pinned stubs keys.s / scale.s. A
|     ROM unit cannot name a DRAM symbol and a DRAM unit cannot name a ROM
|     one at link time, so this unit reaches the pinned mailbox and the
|     scale accessor as FIXED addresses (KEYS_AT, SCALE_AT: the contracts
|     poly.s uses), and the manifest's detours and TableGrow entries name
|     this unit's symbols through the platform's symbol table.
|
| A per-project SCALE setting (PROJECT > CONTROL > SEQUENCER, fourth row,
| OFF by default) and three places it acts:
|   * the PTCH knob on the PLAYBACK page (STATIC / FLEX / PICKUP -- any page
|     of kind 0 whose slot A is named "PTCH") steps to the next scale degree
|     instead of one raw unit (raw = 64 + 5 * semitones, 4..124), on the
|     Part's value and, with a [TRIG] key held, on the step's lock;
|   * a [TRIG] key in CHROMATIC trig mode snaps to the nearest degree (ties
|     to the lower one) before the key becomes a pitch, so the voice, the
|     PTCH lock a held or live-recorded trig receives and the box on the
|     screen all carry the snapped value;
|   * the setting rides the project file as a comment line the stock loader
|     skips ("#SEQUENCER_SCALE=n" after PATTERN_CHANGE_CHAIN_BEHAVIOR).
| With SCALE = OFF every detour replays what it displaced and does nothing
| else; the setting byte is in battery RAM (NV_SCALE below, 26 Sep 2026).
|
| GLIDE (24 Sep 2026): a fifth SEQUENCER row, OFF / 1..127, the synth
| machine's glide time (modules/synth: 10 ms at 1 .. 1 s at 127), saved as
| "#SYNTH_GLIDE=n" after the SCALE line. The byte is qz_glide, a battery RAM
| byte (NV_GLIDE; the synth cave reads it as an OS absolute); this unit
| reaches it through qz_glide_of -- the ONE reader, so the storage can move. With GLIDE on, a CHROMATIC key pressed while another key
| of the track is held is a LEGATO note: the stock's trigless-trig path
| (the FUNC + key path) is taken, so the voice is not restarted and only the
| pitch changes (the synth glides to it), the old key's voice note-off is
| suppressed, and the new key becomes the track's held key, so releasing the
| first key does nothing and releasing the last one releases the note (the
| 303 rule). Two more detours in the chromatic key handler, qz_leg1 / qz_leg2.
| LEG (2 Oct 2026): the legato switch is the track's LEG setting (the AMP
| SETUP page's sixth box, OFF / MONO / POLY on a synth track, OFF / MONO on
| any other audio track since 3 Oct 2026, a Part byte; modules/synth) read
| through the engine's po_legmode; GLIDE is the slide time only, everywhere.
|
| PARAPHONIC KEYS (24 Sep 2026): on a FLEX track whose assigned slot is a
| SYNTH* sample (qz_is_synth) and whose Part's VOIC byte -- the LFO page's
| slot 2, SPD3's byte, which the synth's page names VOIC -- is 2..4
| (qz_polytrack), the CHROMATIC keys are polyphonic: a press while keys are
| held starts a fresh voice and ends nothing (qz_leg1); every press posts the
| key for the engine (qz_pkey) and sets its bit in the track's held-key mask
| (qz_pmask, keys.s); a release clears the bit -- the engine releases that
| key's voices -- sends the key's MIDI note-off, and only the LAST key's
| release takes the stock note-off path, which posts the track's AMP release
| (qz_leg0, a third detour on the handler's release path). Legato is off on
| such a track. VOIC 1 (or a byte outside 1..4, the stock 32) and every
| other track: stock, byte for byte -- the mono synth with GLIDE legato.
|
| THE TUNING SYSTEM (27 Sep 2026, synth tracks only): on a FLEX track whose
| slot holds a SYNTH* sample the PTCH byte is SEMITONES -- raw 64 = 0, one
| unit a semitone, -64..+63 (the synth page's clone gives the slot that range;
| modules/synth). Every quantizer path knows it: qz_quant steps by scale
| degree over raw = 64 + n (qz_pcof computes the pitch class instead of the
| sample tracks' 5-per-semitone table), and qz_chrom turns a key into raw =
| 64 + (key - 12) + 12 * octave. The CHROMATIC octave on a synth track is
| qz_oct, -4..+4 (FUNC + LEFT / RIGHT, qz_octkey), a byte of this unit, while
| the stock word stays 0 there (qz_keyidx, qz_octdraw): the key index the
| stock handler sees is the physical key, 0..15, so its range check, the held
| key byte, the MIDI note out (72 + key, octave 0's notes) and the key mask
| are the stock's. The keyboard drawing prints qz_oct beside the keys
| (qz_octnum, stock's own "%d"). MIDI IN on a synth track is the synth
| module's since 30 Sep 2026 (modules/synth/poly.s po_mon and friends: the
| STANDARD map's chromatic notes become keys of their own, raw = note - 20,
| the full range; this unit's qz_midi detour at 0x4000e74c is gone: the synth's po_mon sits at the block's START, 0x4000e746).
| Sample tracks: byte for byte stock.
|
| FINGERED CHORDS (26 Sep 2026): the recorder detours hand every CHROMATIC
| key of a synth track to the synth engine's po_keyrec (modules/synth/
| poly.s, through the pointer it publishes before sy_render): qz_leg3 asks
| first whether the key JOINS the chord being recorded (then the chord's
| step gets its PTCH / CHRD / VOIC locks and the key records no trig of
| its own), and a fourth detour, qz_leg5, hands a key the recorder did
| record (track, key, step, raw) over to start the next chord record. The
| recognition and the stock-writer calls are the engine's. The HOLD table
| this unit carried (qz_hold128, 256 B) is read
| from the engine's po_hold128 through the same pointer block since then,
| so the ROM unit is smaller than before. The second pass (26 Sep 2026):
| qz_holdrel calls the engine's po_keyrel (the block's -20) at every key
| release with the track's four HOLD slots -- a key that joined a chord
| less than 50 ms before another key of it went up was a legato hand-over,
| and the engine gives it its own trig and a slot among the four; qz_oct
| lives in the pinned keys.s so the engine can pitch a key the handler
| never posted (two keys in one scan).
|
| Linked by the build at the address it lands on (modules/quantizer/
| manifest.py names the sites); the only absolute references to itself are
| the qz_names entries, which the linker resolves.

| Two bytes of the unit's BATTERY-BACKED RAM (CS1, 0x10000000..: the same
| chip that keeps CHAIN AFTER at 0x100b14ae across a power cycle), in the
| linker's padding between the last UI-mirror long 0x100b14de..e1 and the
| 16-byte-aligned project record at 0x100b14f0 (0x100b14e2..ef: no
| reference in the OS, outside both blocks the boot copies to 0x80000000).
| Until 26 Sep 2026 they lived in the OS image (this unit, the pinned
| glide.s), which the bootstrap copies afresh from flash at every power-on:
| the settings reached project.work and project.strd (the serializer hooks
| below) but a power cycle never reads those files -- the unit comes back
| from battery RAM (0x4001fb3c.., the memcpy of 0x100b1480 to 0x80000020)
| and only PROJECT > CHANGE / RELOAD run the loader. So SAVE "lost" SCALE
| and GLIDE at the next boot. Now the setting IS the battery byte: read and

| ---- the CHROMATIC octave on a synth track --------------------------------------
| Stock keeps ONE octave word for the keyboard, OCT_WORD, 0 or 1: FUNC + LEFT
| or RIGHT eor it (0x40045918), the key handler's caller adds 12 * word to the
| key (0x40050254) and the drawer picks the 16- or 13-key picture by it
| (0x40044968), prints it with "%d" (0x400449b8) and places the held-key marks
| with it (0x40044abe). On a synth track the octave is qz_oct instead, -4..+4:
| the stock word is held at 0 there (the key index stays the physical key,
| the marks land on the keys, the 16-key picture shows), qz_chrom adds the 12
| * qz_oct, and the number beside the keyboard is qz_oct. Sample tracks: the
| displaced instructions, byte for byte.

| ---- GLIDE legato: two jmp detours in the same handler --------------------------
| 0x4004fb94 keeps ONE held key per track (HELD + track = key + 1). Stock, a
| press while a key is held first ends that key -- 0x4004fbfe..0x4004fc40: the
| voice note-off (mailbox 0x46c80354[track] |= 0x40, which the frame builder
| turns into the AMP release, 0x4000b4e4), the MIDI note-off (key + 71) and
| held := 0 -- and then starts a new voice (0x4004fcb2: 0x40005030, cmd 0x1d,
| bit 2 = start); a release of a key that is not the held one does nothing
| (0x4004fbe6). With FUNC held (FUNC_HELD) stock skips the note-off and posts
| a TRIGLESS trig instead (0x4004fc9c: mailbox |= 0x119, no bit 2: the staged
| PTCH lock 0x46c7dfda + track*32 is applied at the next frame, 0x4000b75c,
| and the voice is not restarted -- 0x4000b5a8 starts one only on bit 2).
|
| THE LEG GATE (2 Oct 2026): what a press while a key is held does is the
| track's LEG setting (the AMP SETUP page's sixth box, a Part byte: OFF /
| MONO / POLY on a synth track, OFF / MONO on a sample track since 3 Oct
| 2026, modules/synth/poly.s po_legmode), read through the
| engine's pointer block (qz_legmode: -24 of sy_render) -- 0 stock (a sample
| track with LEG OFF, or a synth track at VOIC 1 with LEG OFF: the held note
| ends, the new one starts), 1 mono legato (VOIC 1, LEG MONO or POLY; a sample
| track with LEG MONO, the 2.6 legato -- the engine's rule: the trigless path
| without FUNC -- the old key's MIDI note-off goes out as stock, the voice
| note-off does not, and the NEW key becomes the held key: releasing the
| first key does nothing, releasing the last one releases the note as
| stock), 2 paraphonic (VOIC 2..4, LEG OFF or MONO: the keys are polyphonic,
| "Paraphonic keys" below), 3 paraphonic legato (VOIC 2..4, LEG POLY: the key
| joins the held set, the engine is told through po_legkey (-28) and the
| trigless path follows -- the sounding chord slides to the key, no
| retrigger; recorded as a trigless trig). GLIDE is the slide TIME only now,
| on every track (until 2 Oct 2026 GLIDE != 0 was the legato switch, on any
| track; until 3 Oct 2026 still on a sample track). FUNC
